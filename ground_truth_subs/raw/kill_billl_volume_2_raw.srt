00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:04,401
<i></i>

2
00:00:15,062 --> 00:00:17,353
<i>Do you find me sadistic?</i>

3
00:00:18,682 --> 00:00:21,144
<i>You know, Kiddo...</i>

4
00:00:21,232 --> 00:00:23,692
<i>... I'd like to believe...</i>

5
00:00:23,772 --> 00:00:26,402
<i>... you're aware enough, even now...</i>

6
00:00:27,402 --> 00:00:31,112
<i>... to know that there's nothing sadistic...</i>

7
00:00:31,202 --> 00:00:33,072
<i>... in my actions.</i>

8
00:00:34,622 --> 00:00:35,787
<i>At this moment...</i>

9
00:00:35,822 --> 00:00:36,952
<i>At this moment...</i>

10
00:00:38,372 --> 00:00:40,042
<i>... this is me...</i>

11
00:00:41,042 --> 00:00:43,752
<i>... at my most masochistic.</i>

12
00:00:43,832 --> 00:00:45,172
<i>Bill.</i>

13
00:00:46,002 --> 00:00:47,802
<i>It's your ba...</i>

14
00:00:52,762 --> 00:00:54,762
<i>Looked dead, didn't I?</i>

15
00:00:54,842 --> 00:00:56,432
Well, I wasn't.

16
00:00:56,512 --> 00:01:00,102
But it wasn't from lack of trying,
I can tell you that.

17
00:01:00,182 --> 00:01:03,312
Actually, Bill's last bullet
put me in a coma -

18
00:01:03,402 --> 00:01:06,692
a coma I was to lie in for four years.

19
00:01:07,442 --> 00:01:11,782
When I woke up, I went on what
the movie advertisements refer to as

20
00:01:11,862 --> 00:01:15,412
"a roaring rampage of revenge."

21
00:01:15,492 --> 00:01:18,542
I roared, and I rampaged,

22
00:01:18,622 --> 00:01:21,292
and I got bloody satisfaction.

23
00:01:22,292 --> 00:01:26,172
I've killed a hell of a lot of people
to get to this point,

24
00:01:26,252 --> 00:01:28,462
but I've only one more.

25
00:01:29,302 --> 00:01:31,552
The last one.

26
00:01:31,632 --> 00:01:34,222
The one I'm driving to right now.

27
00:01:35,222 --> 00:01:38,012
The only one left.

28
00:01:38,102 --> 00:01:41,732
And when I arrive at my destination,

29
00:01:41,812 --> 00:01:45,192
I am gonna kill Bill.

30
00:02:10,462 --> 00:02:13,802
<i>The incident that happened
at the Two Pines Wedding Chapel</i>

31
00:02:13,882 --> 00:02:17,052
<i>that put this whole gory story into motion</i>

32
00:02:17,142 --> 00:02:19,642
<i>has since become legend.</i>

33
00:02:19,722 --> 00:02:22,642
<i>"Massacre at Two Pines."</i>

34
00:02:22,722 --> 00:02:24,522
<i>That's what the newspapers called it.</i>

35
00:02:24,602 --> 00:02:26,272
<i>The local TV news called it,</i>

36
00:02:26,352 --> 00:02:30,612
<i>"The El Paso, Texas
Wedding Chapel Massacre."</i>

37
00:02:30,692 --> 00:02:33,402
<i>How it happened, who was there,</i>

38
00:02:33,492 --> 00:02:36,282
<i>how many got killed
and who killed them -</i>

39
00:02:36,362 --> 00:02:40,082
<i>changes depending on
who's telling the story.</i>

40
00:02:40,162 --> 00:02:44,622
<i>In actual fact, the massacre didn't
happen during a wedding at all.</i>

41
00:02:45,542 --> 00:02:47,872
<i>It was a wedding rehearsal.</i>

42
00:02:47,962 --> 00:02:50,752
Now, when we come
to the part where I say,

43
00:02:50,842 --> 00:02:54,382
"You may kiss the bride,"
you may kiss the bride.

44
00:02:54,462 --> 00:02:57,432
But don't stick your tongue in her mouth.

45
00:02:59,432 --> 00:03:01,642
This might be funny to your friends,

46
00:03:01,722 --> 00:03:05,022
but it would be embarrassing
to your parents.

47
00:03:06,562 --> 00:03:09,732
We'll try to restrain ourselves, Reverend.

48
00:03:10,902 --> 00:03:12,902
Y'all got a song?

49
00:03:16,322 --> 00:03:19,572
How about "Love Me Tender"?
I can play that.

50
00:03:19,662 --> 00:03:21,702
- Sure.
- Yeah.

51
00:03:21,782 --> 00:03:24,122
"Love Me Tender" would be great.

52
00:03:24,202 --> 00:03:26,332
Rufus - he's the man.

53
00:03:27,332 --> 00:03:30,462
Rufus, who was that
that you used to play for?

54
00:03:30,542 --> 00:03:32,382
Rufus Thomas.

55
00:03:32,462 --> 00:03:35,382
Rufus Thomas.
Rufus Thomas.

56
00:03:35,462 --> 00:03:39,882
I was a Drell. I was a Drifter.
I was a Coaster.

57
00:03:39,972 --> 00:03:43,512
I was part of the Gang.
I was a Barkay.

58
00:03:43,602 --> 00:03:46,932
If they come through Texas,
I done played with 'em.

59
00:03:47,982 --> 00:03:51,772
Rufus - he's the man.

60
00:03:54,362 --> 00:03:56,532
- Have I forgotten anything?
- Um...

61
00:03:56,612 --> 00:04:00,202
Oh yes, you forgot, uh,
the seating arrangements.

62
00:04:00,282 --> 00:04:01,952
- Thank you, Mother.
- Yes.

63
00:04:03,032 --> 00:04:05,202
Now, the way we normally do this -

64
00:04:05,292 --> 00:04:09,372
we have the bride's side,
and then we have the groom's side.

65
00:04:09,462 --> 00:04:12,672
But since the bride
ain't got nobody comin',

66
00:04:12,752 --> 00:04:16,802
and the groom's got
far too many people comin'...

67
00:04:16,882 --> 00:04:19,262
Well, yeah, they're comin'
all the way from Oklahoma.

68
00:04:21,472 --> 00:04:22,972
Right...

69
00:04:23,052 --> 00:04:26,102
Well, I don't see no problem with...

70
00:04:26,182 --> 00:04:29,482
...the groom's side
sharing the bride's side.

71
00:04:29,562 --> 00:04:32,402
- Do you, Mother?
- I don't have a problem with that.

72
00:04:32,482 --> 00:04:33,482
But, uh...

73
00:04:33,562 --> 00:04:37,902
Honey, you know, it would be good
if you had somebody come.

74
00:04:38,742 --> 00:04:41,072
You know, as a sign of good faith?

75
00:04:42,662 --> 00:04:44,782
Well, I don't have anybody...

76
00:04:44,872 --> 00:04:48,952
...except for Tommy and my friends.

77
00:04:49,042 --> 00:04:53,252
- You have no family?
- Well, I'm workin' on changing that.

78
00:04:53,332 --> 00:04:57,632
Mrs. Harmony, we're all the family
this little ángel's ever gonna need.

79
00:04:59,262 --> 00:05:03,432
I'm not feeling very well,
and this bitch is starting to piss me off.

80
00:05:03,512 --> 00:05:07,102
So while y'all blather on,
I'm gonna go outside and get some air.

81
00:05:08,102 --> 00:05:10,272
OK. Um, uh, Reverend, sorry, uh...

82
00:05:10,352 --> 00:05:13,772
- She's gonna go out and get some air.
- Yeah. Given her delicate condition...

83
00:05:13,852 --> 00:05:16,692
She just needs a few minutes
to get it together. She'll be OK.

84
00:05:16,772 --> 00:05:18,152
Right...

85
00:06:36,232 --> 00:06:37,692
Hello, Kiddo.

86
00:06:42,942 --> 00:06:47,532
- How did you find me?
- I'm the man.

87
00:06:51,202 --> 00:06:53,412
What are you doin' here?

88
00:06:54,412 --> 00:06:56,622
What am I doin'?

89
00:06:58,122 --> 00:07:00,252
Well...

90
00:07:00,342 --> 00:07:03,802
...moment ago I was playin' my flute.

91
00:07:09,552 --> 00:07:11,802
At this moment...

92
00:07:12,812 --> 00:07:17,392
...I'm lookin' at the most beautiful bride
these old eyes have ever seen.

93
00:07:18,982 --> 00:07:22,822
- Why are you here?
- Last look.

94
00:07:25,152 --> 00:07:29,492
- Are you gonna be nice?
- I've never been nice in my whole life.

95
00:07:31,122 --> 00:07:34,492
But I'll do my best to be sweet.

96
00:07:34,582 --> 00:07:35,582
Hmm.

97
00:07:36,752 --> 00:07:39,082
I always told you...

98
00:07:39,172 --> 00:07:42,542
...your sweet side is you best side.

99
00:07:42,632 --> 00:07:47,512
I guess that's why you're
the only one who's ever seen it.

100
00:07:49,592 --> 00:07:53,812
- So you got a bun in the oven.
- Hmm.

101
00:07:55,182 --> 00:07:58,562
- I'm knocked up.
- Jeez, Louise.

102
00:07:59,692 --> 00:08:05,232
That young man of yours sure doesn't
believe in wasting time, does he?

103
00:08:05,322 --> 00:08:07,862
Have you seen Tommy?

104
00:08:09,952 --> 00:08:13,202
- Big guy in the tux?
- Yes.

105
00:08:13,282 --> 00:08:15,332
Then I saw him.

106
00:08:16,492 --> 00:08:18,752
I like his hair.

107
00:08:19,752 --> 00:08:22,292
You promised you'd be nice.

108
00:08:24,212 --> 00:08:28,922
No, I said I'd do my best.
That's hardly a promise.

109
00:08:29,012 --> 00:08:31,262
But you're right.

110
00:08:31,342 --> 00:08:34,802
What does your young man
do for a living?

111
00:08:36,222 --> 00:08:39,142
He owns a used record store
here in El Paso.

112
00:08:39,232 --> 00:08:43,772
- Ah. Music lover, eh?
- He's fond of music.

113
00:08:45,062 --> 00:08:47,112
Aren't we all?

114
00:08:50,902 --> 00:08:54,912
And what are you doing
for a J-O-B these days?

115
00:08:56,412 --> 00:08:59,332
I work in the record store.

116
00:08:59,412 --> 00:09:01,872
<i>Aso.</i>

117
00:09:03,002 --> 00:09:06,002
It all suddenly seems so clear.

118
00:09:08,462 --> 00:09:13,092
- Do you like it?
- Yeah. I like it a lot, smartass.

119
00:09:14,142 --> 00:09:16,682
I get to listen to music all day...

120
00:09:16,762 --> 00:09:20,392
...talk about music all day.
It's really cool.

121
00:09:21,482 --> 00:09:25,272
It's gonna be a great environment
for my little girl to grow up in.

122
00:09:28,112 --> 00:09:32,702
As opposed to jetting around the world,
killing human beings,

123
00:09:32,782 --> 00:09:35,492
and being paid vast sums of money?

124
00:09:37,622 --> 00:09:39,162
Precisely.

125
00:09:39,242 --> 00:09:42,082
Well, my old friend...

126
00:09:42,162 --> 00:09:44,542
...to each his own.

127
00:09:44,622 --> 00:09:49,172
However, all cockblockery aside...

128
00:09:49,252 --> 00:09:52,722
I am looking forward
to meeting your young man.

129
00:09:52,802 --> 00:09:58,182
I happen to be, more or less,
particular whom my gal marries.

130
00:10:00,472 --> 00:10:04,442
- You want to come to the wedding?
- Only if I can sit on the bride's side.

131
00:10:06,062 --> 00:10:08,652
You'll find it a bit lonely on my side.

132
00:10:08,732 --> 00:10:12,152
Your side always was a bit lonely.

133
00:10:12,242 --> 00:10:15,072
But I wouldn't sit anywhere else.

134
00:10:17,532 --> 00:10:19,702
You know...

135
00:10:19,782 --> 00:10:22,252
...I had the loveliest dream about you...

136
00:10:22,332 --> 00:10:24,712
Oh, here's Tommy!
Call me Arlene.

137
00:10:25,462 --> 00:10:26,962
You must be Tommy!

138
00:10:27,042 --> 00:10:29,252
Arlene's told me so much about you.

139
00:10:29,342 --> 00:10:32,382
- Honey, you OK?
- Oh, I'm fine.

140
00:10:32,462 --> 00:10:35,012
Tommy, I'd like you to meet my father.

141
00:10:36,472 --> 00:10:38,262
Oh, my God!

142
00:10:38,342 --> 00:10:40,472
Oh, my God, this is great!

143
00:10:40,562 --> 00:10:43,142
I'm so glad to meet you, sir... uh, Dad.

144
00:10:43,222 --> 00:10:45,482
The name's Bill.

145
00:10:45,602 --> 00:10:47,402
Well, it's great to meet you... Bill.

146
00:10:47,482 --> 00:10:51,112
- Arlene told me you couldn't make it.
- Surprise.

147
00:10:51,192 --> 00:10:54,402
That's my pop for ya.
Always full of surprises.

148
00:10:54,492 --> 00:10:57,912
Well, in the surprise department...

149
00:10:57,992 --> 00:11:01,372
...the apple doesn't fall far from the tree.

150
00:11:01,452 --> 00:11:03,702
- When did you get in?
- Just now.

151
00:11:03,792 --> 00:11:06,792
- Did you come straight from Australia?
- Of course.

152
00:11:06,872 --> 00:11:10,332
Daddy, I told Tommy that you were
in Perth mining for silver, and...

153
00:11:10,422 --> 00:11:12,802
...no one could reach you.

154
00:11:12,882 --> 00:11:16,302
Lucky for us all, that's not the case.

155
00:11:16,382 --> 00:11:18,342
So...

156
00:11:18,432 --> 00:11:22,142
What's this all about?
I've heard of wedding rehearsals,

157
00:11:22,222 --> 00:11:26,602
but I don't believe I've ever heard of
a wedding dress rehearsal before.

158
00:11:26,682 --> 00:11:27,942
We thought,

159
00:11:28,022 --> 00:11:31,272
"Why pay so much money for a dress
you're only going to wear once?"

160
00:11:31,362 --> 00:11:34,282
Especially when Arlene looks
so goddamn beautiful in it.

161
00:11:34,362 --> 00:11:37,902
So, I think we're going to try to get
all the mileage we can out of it.

162
00:11:39,492 --> 00:11:42,702
Isn't it supposed to be bad luck
for the groom to see the bride

163
00:11:42,782 --> 00:11:45,912
in her wedding dress
before the ceremony?

164
00:11:46,542 --> 00:11:50,332
Well, I guess I just believe
in living dangerously.

165
00:11:52,082 --> 00:11:54,302
I know just what you mean.

166
00:11:54,382 --> 00:11:57,632
<i>Son.
Some of us have places to be.</i>

167
00:11:57,722 --> 00:11:59,222
<i>Sure do.</i>

168
00:11:59,302 --> 00:12:03,682
Look, we got to go through this one
more time. So, why don't you have a s...

169
00:12:03,762 --> 00:12:07,682
Oh, my God. What am I thinking?
You should give her away!

170
00:12:07,772 --> 00:12:11,562
Tommy, that's not exactly
Daddy's cup of tea.

171
00:12:11,652 --> 00:12:14,072
I think Father would be
much more comfortable

172
00:12:14,152 --> 00:12:17,112
- sitting with the rest of the guests.
- Hmm. Really?

173
00:12:17,192 --> 00:12:19,322
That's asking a lot.

174
00:12:20,572 --> 00:12:23,662
Oh. OK.
Well, forget it.

175
00:12:23,742 --> 00:12:26,702
But how about we go out
to dinner tonight to celebrate?

176
00:12:26,792 --> 00:12:29,372
Only on the condition that
I pay for everything.

177
00:12:29,462 --> 00:12:31,792
Deal. We got to do this now.

178
00:12:31,872 --> 00:12:35,922
- Can I watch?
- Absolutely. Have a seat.

179
00:12:36,002 --> 00:12:39,302
- Which is the bride's side?
- Right over here.

180
00:12:42,682 --> 00:12:44,802
Mother, here we go!

181
00:12:46,312 --> 00:12:49,602
Now son, about them vows...

182
00:12:55,692 --> 00:12:57,022
Bill...

183
00:12:58,032 --> 00:13:02,742
- I just want...
- You don't owe me a damn thing.

184
00:13:02,822 --> 00:13:05,412
If he's the man you want...

185
00:13:05,492 --> 00:13:08,332
...then go stand by him.

186
00:13:31,932 --> 00:13:36,062
- Do I look pretty?
- Oh, yes.

187
00:13:46,622 --> 00:13:48,662
Thank you.

188
00:14:23,532 --> 00:14:25,152
What the hell?

189
00:14:26,612 --> 00:14:28,572
No! Bill!

190
00:15:07,862 --> 00:15:13,952
You tellin' me she cut her way through
88 bodyguards before she got to O-Ren?

191
00:15:14,042 --> 00:15:16,082
Nah, there wasn't really 88 of 'em.

192
00:15:16,162 --> 00:15:18,922
They just call themselves
"The Crazy 88"

193
00:15:19,002 --> 00:15:21,042
- How come?
- I don't know.

194
00:15:21,132 --> 00:15:24,172
I guess they thought it sounded cool.

195
00:15:24,262 --> 00:15:28,092
Anyhow, they all fell
under her Hanzo sword.

196
00:15:28,182 --> 00:15:32,182
- She got a Hanzo sword?
- He made one for her.

197
00:15:32,262 --> 00:15:35,682
Didn't he swear a blood oath
to never make another sword?

198
00:15:35,772 --> 00:15:39,352
It would appear he has broken it.

199
00:15:41,562 --> 00:15:45,322
Them Japs sure know how
to hold a grudge, don't they?

200
00:15:47,652 --> 00:15:49,412
Or maybe...

201
00:15:49,492 --> 00:15:53,332
...you just tend
to bring that out in people.

202
00:15:53,412 --> 00:15:57,582
I know this is a ridiculous question
before I ask it,

203
00:15:57,662 --> 00:16:02,132
but you haven't, by any chance,
kept up with your... swordplay?

204
00:16:04,712 --> 00:16:06,052
I, um...

205
00:16:07,052 --> 00:16:10,512
I pawned that years ago.

206
00:16:10,592 --> 00:16:13,932
You hocked a Hattori Hanzo sword?

207
00:16:14,602 --> 00:16:16,062
Yep.

208
00:16:16,142 --> 00:16:18,142
It was priceless.

209
00:16:22,562 --> 00:16:26,072
Well, not in El Paso, it ain't.

210
00:16:27,072 --> 00:16:30,202
In El Paso, I got me $250 for it.

211
00:16:31,822 --> 00:16:34,742
I'm a bouncer in a titty bar, Bill.

212
00:16:37,452 --> 00:16:40,752
If she wants to fight with me, all she's
got to do is come to the club

213
00:16:40,832 --> 00:16:43,672
and start some shit,
and we'll be in a fight.

214
00:16:45,292 --> 00:16:49,092
I know we haven't spoken in some time,

215
00:16:50,172 --> 00:16:53,972
and the last time we spoke
wasn't the most pleasant,

216
00:16:54,052 --> 00:16:58,472
but you've got to get over
being mad at me,

217
00:16:58,562 --> 00:17:00,732
and start becoming afraid of -,

218
00:17:00,812 --> 00:17:04,402
because she is coming,
and she's coming to kill you.

219
00:17:05,732 --> 00:17:10,032
And unless you accept my assistance,
I have no doubt she will succeed.

220
00:17:18,952 --> 00:17:23,872
I don't dodge guilt, and I don't Jew
out of paying my comeuppance.

221
00:17:26,002 --> 00:17:29,552
Can't we just... forget the past?

222
00:17:32,342 --> 00:17:34,302
That woman...

223
00:17:34,392 --> 00:17:36,602
...deserves her revenge.

224
00:17:41,602 --> 00:17:43,022
And...

225
00:17:43,892 --> 00:17:45,692
...we deserve to die.

226
00:17:50,692 --> 00:17:53,402
But then again...

227
00:17:53,492 --> 00:17:55,492
...so does she.

228
00:17:58,912 --> 00:18:00,622
So I guess...

229
00:18:01,622 --> 00:18:03,712
...we'll just see.

230
00:18:05,122 --> 00:18:07,132
Won't we?

231
00:18:43,542 --> 00:18:45,412
Late again.

232
00:18:45,502 --> 00:18:47,672
Budd, can't you tell time?

233
00:18:48,712 --> 00:18:50,672
There ain't nobody in here, man.

234
00:18:50,752 --> 00:18:52,962
- Is that Budd?
- Yeah.

235
00:18:53,052 --> 00:18:55,972
Tell him to get
his fucking ass back here!

236
00:18:56,052 --> 00:18:57,842
OK.

237
00:18:57,932 --> 00:19:01,512
Budd, Larry'd like a word with ya.

238
00:19:06,232 --> 00:19:09,272
Take a hit.
Be somebody, baby.

239
00:19:18,532 --> 00:19:20,372
You looking for me?

240
00:19:26,372 --> 00:19:30,082
I don't know what car wash
you worked before you came here

241
00:19:30,172 --> 00:19:33,592
that let you stroll in 20 minutes late,
but it wasn't owned by me

242
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:36,302
- and I own a fuckin' car wash.
- Do you want me to leave?

243
00:19:36,382 --> 00:19:38,722
No, I don't want you to leave.
I want you to sit and wait.

244
00:19:38,802 --> 00:19:40,722
Larry...

245
00:19:41,682 --> 00:19:44,812
...there ain't nobody out there, so...

246
00:19:44,892 --> 00:19:48,892
<i>"There's nobody
out there, Larry."</i>

247
00:19:50,352 --> 00:19:52,402
What's your point?

248
00:19:52,482 --> 00:19:57,192
- That you're not needed here?
- My point is...

249
00:19:57,282 --> 00:20:01,822
...I'm the bouncer, and there
ain't nobody out there to bounce.

250
00:20:01,912 --> 00:20:05,202
You're saying that the reason...

251
00:20:05,292 --> 00:20:09,292
...that you're not doing the job that I'm...

252
00:20:09,372 --> 00:20:13,842
...paying you to do is that
you don't have a job to do?

253
00:20:15,962 --> 00:20:18,222
- No...
- Is that what you're saying?

254
00:20:18,302 --> 00:20:20,342
What are you trying
to convince me of, exactly?

255
00:20:20,432 --> 00:20:23,392
That you're as useless
as an asshole right here?

256
00:20:24,432 --> 00:20:26,772
Well, guess what, buddy.

257
00:20:26,852 --> 00:20:30,482
I think... you just fucking convinced me.

258
00:20:32,232 --> 00:20:34,312
Let's go to the calendar.

259
00:20:34,402 --> 00:20:36,572
It's calendar time.

260
00:20:36,652 --> 00:20:39,192
Calendar time for Buddy.

261
00:20:39,282 --> 00:20:42,742
- OK. You working tomorrow?
- Yeah.

262
00:20:42,822 --> 00:20:46,912
Mm. No, you're n... You don't even know
what fucking day you work.

263
00:20:46,992 --> 00:20:49,002
Here. You're not working tomorrow.

264
00:20:49,082 --> 00:20:52,252
You're working Wednesday.
Here you are. There you go.

265
00:20:52,332 --> 00:20:54,422
- Workin' Thursday?
- Yeah.

266
00:20:54,502 --> 00:20:58,672
I don't think so.
Friday.

267
00:20:58,762 --> 00:21:01,012
I d... There's your name.

268
00:21:01,092 --> 00:21:03,972
- If you say so.
- There used to be your name. OK?

269
00:21:04,052 --> 00:21:06,762
- Saturday. There used to be your name.
- Oh.

270
00:21:06,852 --> 00:21:08,222
Uh, Monday...

271
00:21:09,102 --> 00:21:10,392
Here. How about that?

272
00:21:10,482 --> 00:21:15,402
Fuckin' with your cash is the only thing
you kids seem to understand. OK?

273
00:21:16,772 --> 00:21:19,032
Now, I want you to go home till I call you.

274
00:21:19,112 --> 00:21:21,532
Till I call you.

275
00:21:21,612 --> 00:21:25,702
Before you leave, talk to Rocket.
She's got a job for you to do.

276
00:21:27,032 --> 00:21:28,992
And...

277
00:21:30,002 --> 00:21:31,712
...the hat.

278
00:21:32,712 --> 00:21:34,672
That fuckin' hat.

279
00:21:34,752 --> 00:21:38,132
That fucking...

280
00:21:38,712 --> 00:21:41,552
How many times have I told you,

281
00:21:41,632 --> 00:21:45,722
don't wear that fucking hat here?
How many?

282
00:21:49,932 --> 00:21:51,732
Customers wear hats.

283
00:21:51,812 --> 00:21:54,392
Well, I'm not the boss of the customers.

284
00:21:54,482 --> 00:21:56,772
I'm the boss of you.
And I'm telling you...

285
00:21:58,572 --> 00:22:02,032
...that I want you to keep
that shit-kicker hat at home.

286
00:22:36,902 --> 00:22:41,022
Yeah. Budd, honey, uh,
the toilet is at it again.

287
00:22:41,112 --> 00:22:44,032
There's shitty water all over the floor.

288
00:22:44,112 --> 00:22:47,952
OK... Rocket.

289
00:22:49,832 --> 00:22:52,792
- I'll clean it up.
- Mm-hmm.

290
00:26:30,382 --> 00:26:32,552
Now...

291
00:26:32,632 --> 00:26:35,092
...that gentled you down some, didn't it?

292
00:26:44,772 --> 00:26:46,442
Yep.

293
00:26:47,652 --> 00:26:53,612
Ain't nobody a badass with a double
dose of rock salt dug deep in their tits.

294
00:26:57,822 --> 00:27:01,242
Not havin'... tits...

295
00:27:06,002 --> 00:27:08,082
...as fine...

296
00:27:08,172 --> 00:27:10,672
...or as big as yours,

297
00:27:11,342 --> 00:27:15,342
I can't even imagine
how bad that shit must sting.

298
00:27:19,722 --> 00:27:20,722
Yet...

299
00:27:25,392 --> 00:27:27,642
...I don't want to, neither.

300
00:27:48,962 --> 00:27:51,082
I win.

301
00:28:01,642 --> 00:28:04,512
Ugh! Ugh.

302
00:29:03,452 --> 00:29:04,572
Bill.

303
00:29:05,662 --> 00:29:08,202
Wrong brother, ya hateful bitch.

304
00:29:08,292 --> 00:29:10,912
<i>- Budd.
- Bingo.</i>

305
00:29:12,712 --> 00:29:15,172
And to what do I owe
this dubious pleasure?

306
00:29:16,292 --> 00:29:20,132
I just caught me the cowgirl
ain't never been caught.

307
00:29:21,882 --> 00:29:25,602
<i>- Did you kill her?
- Well, not yet, I ain't.</i>

308
00:29:25,722 --> 00:29:28,602
<i>I shot her full of rock salt.</i>

309
00:29:28,682 --> 00:29:33,482
<i>She's so gentle right now, I could
perform her coup de grÃ¢ce with a rock.</i>

310
00:29:34,602 --> 00:29:36,312
Anywho...

311
00:29:39,942 --> 00:29:43,202
Guess what I'm holdin'
in my hand right now?

312
00:29:43,282 --> 00:29:44,282
What?

313
00:29:44,362 --> 00:29:48,492
<i>A brand spankin' new
Hattori Hanzo sword.</i>

314
00:29:49,992 --> 00:29:52,212
And I'm here to tell ya, Elle,

315
00:29:53,212 --> 00:29:56,922
...that's what I call sharp.
- How much?

316
00:29:57,002 --> 00:30:01,592
Oh, that's hard to say,
bein' that it's... priceless and all.

317
00:30:01,672 --> 00:30:04,182
What's the terms?

318
00:30:04,262 --> 00:30:07,352
<i>You get your bony ass down here
first thing in the morning...</i>

319
00:30:08,642 --> 00:30:11,352
...with a million dollars in folding cash...

320
00:30:12,772 --> 00:30:18,192
...and I'll give you the greatest sword
ever made by a man.

321
00:30:22,152 --> 00:30:24,152
<i>Now, how do you like the sound of that?</i>

322
00:30:24,242 --> 00:30:25,862
Sounds like we got a deal.

323
00:30:25,952 --> 00:30:28,952
- One condition.
- What?

324
00:30:29,032 --> 00:30:32,662
She must suffer to her last breath.

325
00:30:32,752 --> 00:30:34,042
<i>Well...</i>

326
00:30:35,292 --> 00:30:37,632
That, Elle darlin'...

327
00:30:38,332 --> 00:30:41,252
...I can pretty much
damn well guarantee.

328
00:30:42,262 --> 00:30:46,052
Then I'll see you
in the mornin', millionaire.

329
00:30:46,132 --> 00:30:47,592
All right.

330
00:31:48,952 --> 00:31:50,572
Wakey, wakey.

331
00:31:51,372 --> 00:31:52,832
Eggs and bakey.

332
00:32:28,112 --> 00:32:29,702
I'm done!

333
00:32:30,572 --> 00:32:33,162
Get me outta this hole!

334
00:32:36,242 --> 00:32:37,582
<i>Good.</i>

335
00:32:47,302 --> 00:32:48,462
<i>Whew.</i>

336
00:33:10,402 --> 00:33:12,452
Whoa, look at those eyes.

337
00:33:12,532 --> 00:33:14,572
This bitch is furious.

338
00:33:16,702 --> 00:33:18,542
What did I tell ya?

339
00:33:19,542 --> 00:33:22,832
Is she the cutest little
blond pussy you ever saw?

340
00:33:22,922 --> 00:33:27,132
Or... is she the cutest little
blond pussy you ever saw?

341
00:33:27,212 --> 00:33:29,382
I seen better.

342
00:33:34,432 --> 00:33:37,312
You got anything to say?

343
00:33:38,932 --> 00:33:42,192
White women call this
"the silent treatment."

344
00:33:42,272 --> 00:33:44,602
And we let 'em think we don't like it.

345
00:33:49,862 --> 00:33:52,532
You grab the feet, I'll get the head.

346
00:33:59,792 --> 00:34:02,252
Hey. Hey. Hey!

347
00:34:03,872 --> 00:34:06,382
Wiggle worm, you see this?

348
00:34:07,672 --> 00:34:09,672
You see it, don't ya?

349
00:34:11,882 --> 00:34:13,512
That's a can of Mace.

350
00:34:13,592 --> 00:34:16,472
Mm-hmm. No.

351
00:34:16,552 --> 00:34:19,642
You're goin' underneath
the ground tonight.

352
00:34:19,722 --> 00:34:23,482
And... that's all there is to it.

353
00:34:26,812 --> 00:34:29,232
I wanna bury ya.

354
00:34:31,822 --> 00:34:34,702
I was gonna bury ya...

355
00:34:40,122 --> 00:34:41,792
...with this.

356
00:34:45,462 --> 00:34:48,632
But if you're gonna
act like a horse's ass...

357
00:34:50,922 --> 00:34:56,552
...I'm gonna spray this whole goddamn
can right in your eyeballs!

358
00:34:56,632 --> 00:35:00,182
I'll burn 'em right outta your fuckin' head.

359
00:35:00,852 --> 00:35:03,642
Then you're gonna be blind...

360
00:35:03,732 --> 00:35:06,142
...and burnin'...

361
00:35:08,312 --> 00:35:10,062
...and buried alive.

362
00:35:15,612 --> 00:35:17,702
Now, what's it gonna be, sister?

363
00:35:28,582 --> 00:35:31,092
That's a wise decision.

364
00:35:44,142 --> 00:35:47,142
This is for breakin' my brother's heart.

365
00:39:36,122 --> 00:39:38,832
Once upon a time...

366
00:39:38,922 --> 00:39:40,462
...in China...

367
00:39:41,752 --> 00:39:45,212
...some believe around the year...

368
00:39:45,302 --> 00:39:48,132
...one double aught-three,

369
00:39:49,302 --> 00:39:55,642
head priest of the White Lotus Clan,
Pai Mei, was walking down a road...

370
00:39:56,772 --> 00:39:58,812
...contemplating whatever it is

371
00:39:58,892 --> 00:40:04,822
that a man of Pai Mei's
infinite powers would contemplate -

372
00:40:04,902 --> 00:40:08,152
which is another way
of saying, "Who knows?" -

373
00:40:09,492 --> 00:40:12,622
when a Shaolin monk
appeared on the road,

374
00:40:12,702 --> 00:40:15,452
traveling in the opposite direction.

375
00:40:15,542 --> 00:40:18,962
As the monk and the priest
crossed paths...

376
00:40:19,962 --> 00:40:22,002
...Pai Mei...

377
00:40:22,082 --> 00:40:27,422
...in a practically unfathomable
display of generosity,

378
00:40:27,512 --> 00:40:30,722
gave the monk the slightest of nods.

379
00:40:32,802 --> 00:40:34,762
The nod...

380
00:40:34,852 --> 00:40:36,772
...was not returned.

381
00:40:40,392 --> 00:40:45,522
Now, was it the intention
of the Shaolin monk to insult Pai Mei?

382
00:40:46,652 --> 00:40:51,822
Or did he just fail to see
the generous social gesture?

383
00:40:51,912 --> 00:40:56,792
The motives of the monk
remain unknown.

384
00:40:56,872 --> 00:40:58,952
What is known...

385
00:40:59,042 --> 00:41:00,962
...were the consequences.

386
00:41:13,842 --> 00:41:18,812
The next morning, Pai Mei
appeared at the Shaolin temple...

387
00:41:20,022 --> 00:41:23,192
...and demanded
of the temple's head abbot

388
00:41:23,272 --> 00:41:28,782
that he offer Pai Mei his neck
to repay the insult.

389
00:41:30,032 --> 00:41:34,452
The abbot, at first,
tried to console Pai Mei.

390
00:41:34,532 --> 00:41:37,542
Only to find Pai Mei was...

391
00:41:38,542 --> 00:41:40,252
...inconsolable.

392
00:41:51,552 --> 00:41:53,432
So began...

393
00:41:53,512 --> 00:41:59,772
...the Massacre of the Shaolin Temple,
and all sixty of the monks inside,

394
00:41:59,852 --> 00:42:01,932
at the fists of the White Lotus.

395
00:42:03,562 --> 00:42:07,062
And... so began the legend...

396
00:42:07,152 --> 00:42:11,822
...of Pai Mei's Five-Point-Palm
Exploding-Heart Technique.

397
00:42:11,902 --> 00:42:14,112
And what, pray tell,
is the Five-Point-Palm

398
00:42:14,202 --> 00:42:16,822
- Exploding-Heart Technique?
- Quite simply,

399
00:42:16,912 --> 00:42:21,082
the deadliest blow in all of martial arts.

400
00:42:23,462 --> 00:42:26,832
He hits you with his fingertips...

401
00:42:26,922 --> 00:42:30,882
...at five different pressure
points on your body...

402
00:42:30,962 --> 00:42:33,882
...and then lets you walk away.

403
00:42:35,052 --> 00:42:38,012
But once you've taken five steps...

404
00:42:38,102 --> 00:42:42,102
...your heart explodes inside your body...

405
00:42:42,182 --> 00:42:45,352
...and you fall to the floor, dead.

406
00:42:45,442 --> 00:42:48,562
- Did he teach you that?
- No.

407
00:42:50,442 --> 00:42:54,862
He teaches no one the Five-Point-Palm
Exploding-Heart Technique.

408
00:42:55,532 --> 00:42:57,572
Now...

409
00:42:57,662 --> 00:43:01,332
...one of the things
I've always liked about you...

410
00:43:01,412 --> 00:43:02,912
...Kiddo...

411
00:43:04,622 --> 00:43:07,502
...is you appear
wise beyond your years.

412
00:43:11,502 --> 00:43:15,262
So, allow me to impart
a word to the wise:

413
00:43:16,262 --> 00:43:17,722
Whatever...

414
00:43:17,802 --> 00:43:22,312
...whatever Pai Mei says, obey.

415
00:43:23,312 --> 00:43:28,442
If you flash him, even for an instant,
a defiant eye, he'll pluck it out.

416
00:43:28,522 --> 00:43:33,732
And if you throw any
American sass his way...

417
00:43:33,822 --> 00:43:37,072
...he'll snap your back and your neck
like they were twigs.

418
00:43:40,452 --> 00:43:43,332
And that will be the story of you.

419
00:44:03,562 --> 00:44:06,102
He'll accept you as his student.

420
00:44:06,182 --> 00:44:08,272
- What happened to you?
- Nothin'.

421
00:44:08,352 --> 00:44:11,192
- Get in a fight?
- Friendly contest.

422
00:44:11,272 --> 00:44:12,942
Why did he accept me?

423
00:44:13,022 --> 00:44:17,322
Because he's a very, very, very old man.

424
00:44:17,402 --> 00:44:19,612
And like all rotten bastards...

425
00:44:20,612 --> 00:44:24,292
...when they become old,
they get lonely.

426
00:44:25,952 --> 00:44:28,832
Which has no effect
on their dispositions,

427
00:44:28,912 --> 00:44:32,502
but it does teach them
the value of company.

428
00:44:34,252 --> 00:44:36,342
Whew. Oh.

429
00:44:36,422 --> 00:44:40,722
Just seein' those
steps again makes me ache.

430
00:44:41,682 --> 00:44:43,182
You're gonna have a lot of fun

431
00:44:43,262 --> 00:44:46,772
carrying buckets of water
up and down that fucker.

432
00:44:51,732 --> 00:44:53,692
When will I see you again?

433
00:44:53,772 --> 00:44:57,192
That's the title of my favorite
soul song of the seventies.

434
00:44:57,282 --> 00:44:59,282
- What?
- Nothin'.

435
00:45:00,112 --> 00:45:02,662
When he tells me you're done.

436
00:45:02,742 --> 00:45:04,532
When do you think that might be?

437
00:45:04,622 --> 00:45:07,542
That, my dearest,
depends entirely on you.

438
00:45:07,622 --> 00:45:11,122
Now remember,
no sarcasm, no backtalk.

439
00:45:11,212 --> 00:45:13,542
At least not for the first year or so.

440
00:45:13,672 --> 00:45:16,882
You're gonna have to let him
warm up to you.

441
00:45:16,962 --> 00:45:20,552
He hates Caucasians,
despises Americans,

442
00:45:20,632 --> 00:45:23,682
and has nothing
but contempt for women.

443
00:45:26,062 --> 00:45:29,432
So, in your case...
it might take a little while.

444
00:45:30,272 --> 00:45:33,102
<i>Adiós.</i>

445
00:47:12,622 --> 00:47:13,752
Master...

446
00:47:15,582 --> 00:47:17,292
Your Mandarin is lousy.

447
00:47:18,252 --> 00:47:19,592
It causes my ears discomfort.

448
00:47:19,672 --> 00:47:21,302
You bray like an ass!

449
00:47:22,092 --> 00:47:24,212
You are not to speak unless spoken to.

450
00:47:25,132 --> 00:47:28,682
Is it too much to hope -
you understand Cantonese?

451
00:47:32,472 --> 00:47:33,852
I speak Japanese very well-

452
00:47:33,932 --> 00:47:37,232
I didn't ask if you speak Japanese -

453
00:47:37,312 --> 00:47:39,442
I asked if you understand Cantonese?

454
00:47:40,812 --> 00:47:41,982
A little.

455
00:47:42,652 --> 00:47:47,282
You are here to learn the mysteries
of Kung Fu, not linguistics.

456
00:47:47,652 --> 00:47:49,362
If you can't understand me -

457
00:47:49,452 --> 00:47:51,332
I will communicate with you
like I would a dog.

458
00:47:51,662 --> 00:47:55,162
When I yell, when I point,
when I beat you with my stick!

459
00:48:01,212 --> 00:48:03,092
Bill is your master, is he not?

460
00:48:04,842 --> 00:48:06,512
Yes, he is.

461
00:48:08,842 --> 00:48:12,642
Your master tells me -
you're not entirely unschooled.

462
00:48:13,562 --> 00:48:15,022
What training do you possess?

463
00:48:15,722 --> 00:48:18,102
I am proficient in Tiger-Crane Style,

464
00:48:18,192 --> 00:48:22,482
and I am more than proficient in the
exquisite art of the Samurai sword.

465
00:48:23,732 --> 00:48:26,742
The exquisite art of the Samurai sword.
Don't make me laugh!

466
00:48:26,822 --> 00:48:31,492
Your so-called exquisite art,
is only fit for -

467
00:48:31,872 --> 00:48:33,452
Japanese fat heads!

468
00:48:38,582 --> 00:48:43,712
Your anger amuses me.
Do you believe you are my match?

469
00:48:44,252 --> 00:48:44,882
No.

470
00:48:45,712 --> 00:48:47,672
Are you aware I kill at will?

471
00:48:48,342 --> 00:48:49,382
Yes.

472
00:48:49,882 --> 00:48:51,262
Is it your wish to die?

473
00:48:51,342 --> 00:48:52,222
No.

474
00:48:54,222 --> 00:48:55,142
Then you must be stupid...

475
00:48:55,222 --> 00:48:57,602
Then you must be stupid... so stupid.

476
00:48:57,682 --> 00:49:01,402
Rise, and let me look at your
ridiculous face.

477
00:49:01,902 --> 00:49:03,062
Rise.

478
00:49:07,612 --> 00:49:13,242
So my pathetic friend...
Is there anything that you can do well?

479
00:49:14,072 --> 00:49:16,032
What's the matter?

480
00:49:16,452 --> 00:49:18,412
Cat got your tongue?

481
00:49:19,872 --> 00:49:22,832
Oh yes, you speak Japanese.

482
00:49:23,462 --> 00:49:24,922
I despise the Goddamn Japs!

483
00:49:27,922 --> 00:49:29,672
Go to that rack.

484
00:49:37,972 --> 00:49:38,932
Remove the sword.

485
00:50:05,292 --> 00:50:07,092
Let's see how good you really are.

486
00:50:07,962 --> 00:50:09,592
If...

487
00:50:10,262 --> 00:50:11,972
...you land a single blow,

488
00:50:13,682 --> 00:50:15,432
I'll bow down and call you master.

489
00:50:29,652 --> 00:50:32,152
From here you can get
an excellent view of my foot.

490
00:50:37,322 --> 00:50:40,792
Your swordsmanship -
is amateur at best.

491
00:50:54,802 --> 00:51:00,142
Your so-called kung-fu - is really -
quite pathetic.

492
00:51:02,982 --> 00:51:06,772
I asked you to demonstrate -
what you know - and you did...

493
00:51:07,482 --> 00:51:08,692
Not a goddamn thing!

494
00:51:09,732 --> 00:51:13,362
Let's see your Tiger Crane -
match my Eagle's Claw.

495
00:52:10,542 --> 00:52:12,502
Like all Yankee women...

496
00:52:12,592 --> 00:52:16,092
...all you can do is order in restaurants
and spend a man's money.

497
00:52:17,222 --> 00:52:18,842
Excruciating - isn't it?

498
00:52:18,932 --> 00:52:20,182
Yes!

499
00:52:21,762 --> 00:52:23,102
If it was my wish...

500
00:52:23,602 --> 00:52:24,892
...I could chop your arm off.

501
00:52:24,972 --> 00:52:26,272
No, please don't!

502
00:52:27,732 --> 00:52:30,022
It's my arm now. I can do what I please.

503
00:52:30,652 --> 00:52:32,732
If you can stop me - I suggest you try.

504
00:52:35,112 --> 00:52:36,112
I can't.

505
00:52:37,282 --> 00:52:38,532
Because you're helpless?

506
00:52:39,402 --> 00:52:40,282
Yes.

507
00:52:42,952 --> 00:52:45,042
Have you ever felt this before?

508
00:52:45,452 --> 00:52:46,242
No.

509
00:52:46,502 --> 00:52:49,922
Compared to me - you're as helpless
as a worm fighting an eagle?

510
00:52:50,922 --> 00:52:52,132
YES!

511
00:52:54,292 --> 00:52:55,052
THAT'S THE BEGINNING!

512
00:53:00,802 --> 00:53:03,472
Is it your wish to possess
this kind of power?

513
00:53:05,892 --> 00:53:06,892
Yes!

514
00:53:09,312 --> 00:53:12,102
Your training will begin - tomorrow.

515
00:53:20,862 --> 00:53:22,242
Since your arm now belongs to me...

516
00:53:23,162 --> 00:53:24,452
...I want it strong.

517
00:53:25,992 --> 00:53:27,412
Can you do that?

518
00:53:29,122 --> 00:53:30,792
I can, but not that close.

519
00:53:30,962 --> 00:53:32,252
Then you can't do it.

520
00:53:33,502 --> 00:53:37,252
What if your enemy -
is three inches in front of you...

521
00:53:38,342 --> 00:53:39,592
...What do you do then...

522
00:53:40,722 --> 00:53:41,842
...Curl into a ball...

523
00:53:43,512 --> 00:53:44,762
...or do you put your FIST through him?

524
00:53:46,352 --> 00:53:47,102
Now begin.

525
00:54:19,342 --> 00:54:21,722
It's the wood that should
fear your hand -

526
00:54:21,802 --> 00:54:23,382
not the other way around.

527
00:54:24,222 --> 00:54:28,512
No wonder you can't do it -
you acquiesce to defeat -

528
00:54:28,602 --> 00:54:29,972
before you even begin.

529
00:56:18,462 --> 00:56:20,672
If you want to eat like a dog...

530
00:56:21,962 --> 00:56:23,962
You can live and sleep
outside like a dog.

531
00:56:26,462 --> 00:56:28,342
If you want to live and sleep
like a human...

532
00:56:29,972 --> 00:56:31,472
...pick up those sticks.

533
01:00:02,222 --> 01:00:05,062
Come on, you bitch.

534
01:00:46,642 --> 01:00:49,442
OK, Pai Mei.

535
01:00:51,402 --> 01:00:53,402
Here I come.

536
01:03:02,572 --> 01:03:05,572
May I have a glass of water, please?

537
01:05:43,902 --> 01:05:48,112
- So that's a Texas funeral?
- Yep.

538
01:05:48,902 --> 01:05:51,152
I have to give it to ya, Budd.

539
01:05:51,242 --> 01:05:54,202
That's a pretty fucked up way to die.

540
01:05:54,282 --> 01:05:56,912
What's the name on the grave
she's buried under?

541
01:05:57,622 --> 01:05:59,042
Paula...

542
01:06:01,082 --> 01:06:03,122
...Schultz.

543
01:06:08,302 --> 01:06:09,962
Can I look at the sword?

544
01:06:10,052 --> 01:06:13,512
That's my money right there
in that red bag, isn't it?

545
01:06:13,592 --> 01:06:15,472
It sure is.

546
01:06:16,262 --> 01:06:18,972
Well then, it's your sword now.

547
01:06:37,702 --> 01:06:39,872
What's that you said?

548
01:06:39,952 --> 01:06:42,582
So this is a Hattori Hanzo sword.

549
01:06:42,662 --> 01:06:44,752
That's a Hanzo sword, all right.

550
01:06:44,832 --> 01:06:47,752
Bill tells me you once had
one of these of your own.

551
01:06:49,172 --> 01:06:51,302
Yeah, once.

552
01:06:51,382 --> 01:06:53,972
Yeah? How does this one
compare to that?

553
01:07:03,182 --> 01:07:06,812
If you're gonna compare
a Hanzo sword...

554
01:07:08,362 --> 01:07:12,072
...you compare it
to every other sword ever made -

555
01:07:12,152 --> 01:07:16,362
wasn't made - by Hattori Hanzo.

556
01:07:25,042 --> 01:07:28,292
Here you go.
Wrap your lips around that.

557
01:07:37,432 --> 01:07:39,432
So...

558
01:07:40,182 --> 01:07:42,222
...which "R" are you filled with?

559
01:07:43,312 --> 01:07:44,892
What?

560
01:07:47,982 --> 01:07:49,522
They say...

561
01:07:49,612 --> 01:07:52,232
...the number one killer...

562
01:07:52,322 --> 01:07:54,152
...of old people...

563
01:07:54,242 --> 01:07:55,822
...is retirement.

564
01:07:57,782 --> 01:08:03,872
People got a job to do, they tend to live
a little bit longer so they can do it.

565
01:08:05,452 --> 01:08:07,832
I've always figured that...

566
01:08:07,922 --> 01:08:10,792
...warriors and their enemies...

567
01:08:10,882 --> 01:08:13,672
...share the same relationship.

568
01:08:13,752 --> 01:08:16,512
So now that you're not gonna have
to face your enemy no more

569
01:08:16,592 --> 01:08:19,342
on the battlefield...

570
01:08:20,342 --> 01:08:23,762
...which "R" ya filled with?

571
01:08:25,272 --> 01:08:26,772
Relief...

572
01:08:29,772 --> 01:08:31,612
...or regret?

573
01:08:33,272 --> 01:08:37,032
- A little bit of both.
- Horseshit.

574
01:08:38,822 --> 01:08:41,742
I'm sure you do feel a little bit of both.

575
01:08:41,822 --> 01:08:45,292
But I know damn well that you feel one...

576
01:08:45,372 --> 01:08:48,122
...more than you feel the other.

577
01:08:48,212 --> 01:08:53,592
And the question was:
Which one is it?

578
01:08:54,592 --> 01:08:55,922
Regret.

579
01:08:57,632 --> 01:09:00,052
You know,
you gotta hand it to the ol' girl.

580
01:09:00,132 --> 01:09:03,852
I never saw anybody buffalo Bill
the way she buffaloed Bill.

581
01:09:04,972 --> 01:09:07,062
Bill thought she was so damn smart.

582
01:09:07,142 --> 01:09:08,982
And I tried to tell him...

583
01:09:09,562 --> 01:09:11,942
...she was just smart for a blond.

584
01:09:31,872 --> 01:09:34,002
Thanks a bunch.

585
01:09:45,812 --> 01:09:47,262
All right.

586
01:10:17,502 --> 01:10:19,302
Mmm.

587
01:10:19,382 --> 01:10:20,842
I'm sorry, Budd.

588
01:10:20,922 --> 01:10:23,552
That was rude of me, wasn't it?

589
01:10:23,632 --> 01:10:27,762
Budd, I'd like to introduce my friend,
the black mamba.

590
01:10:27,852 --> 01:10:30,892
Black mamba, this is Budd.

591
01:10:31,562 --> 01:10:33,392
You know, before I picked
that little fella up,

592
01:10:33,482 --> 01:10:35,602
I looked him up on the Internet.

593
01:10:35,692 --> 01:10:38,982
Fascinating creature, the black mamba.

594
01:10:39,072 --> 01:10:40,362
Listen to this:

595
01:10:45,702 --> 01:10:47,872
"In Africa, the saying goes,

596
01:10:47,952 --> 01:10:52,162
"'In the bush, an elephant can kill you,
a leopard can kill you,

597
01:10:52,252 --> 01:10:56,332
"'and a black mamba can kill you.
But only with the mamba,

598
01:10:56,422 --> 01:11:00,882
"and this has been true in Africa
since the dawn of time, is death sure.'

599
01:11:00,962 --> 01:11:07,722
Hence its handle, 'Death Incarnate."'
Pretty cool, huh?

600
01:11:09,102 --> 01:11:12,852
"Its neurotoxic venom is one of
nature's most effective poisons,

601
01:11:12,932 --> 01:11:16,232
"acting on the nervous system,
causing paralysis.

602
01:11:16,312 --> 01:11:19,862
"The venom of a black mamba
can kill a human being in four hours

603
01:11:19,942 --> 01:11:22,692
"if, say, bitten on the ankle or the thumb.

604
01:11:22,782 --> 01:11:26,112
"However, a bite to the face or torso

605
01:11:26,202 --> 01:11:29,912
can bring death from paralysis
within 20 minutes."

606
01:11:29,992 --> 01:11:33,292
Now, you should listen to this,
'cause this concerns you.

607
01:11:35,082 --> 01:11:38,132
"The amount of venom that can be
delivered from a single bite

608
01:11:38,212 --> 01:11:39,882
can be gargantuan."

609
01:11:41,342 --> 01:11:43,802
You know, I've always liked
that word, "gargantuan."

610
01:11:43,882 --> 01:11:47,722
I so rarely have an opportunity
to use it in a sentence.

611
01:11:47,802 --> 01:11:50,142
"If not treated quickly with antivenom,

612
01:11:50,222 --> 01:11:53,062
"ten to 15 milligrams
can be fatal to human beings.

613
01:11:53,142 --> 01:11:55,562
"However, the black mamba can deliver

614
01:11:55,642 --> 01:12:00,562
as much as 100 to 400 milligrams
of venom from a single bite."

615
01:12:03,782 --> 01:12:05,492
Now...

616
01:12:06,822 --> 01:12:10,992
...in these last agonizing
minutes of life you have left,

617
01:12:11,082 --> 01:12:14,372
let me answer that question
you asked earlier more thoroughly.

618
01:12:18,172 --> 01:12:20,172
Right at this moment...

619
01:12:20,832 --> 01:12:24,052
...the biggest "R" I feel is regret.

620
01:12:26,132 --> 01:12:32,052
Regret that maybe
the greatest warrior I have ever met

621
01:12:32,142 --> 01:12:38,192
met her end at the hands
of a bushwhackin', scrub,

622
01:12:38,272 --> 01:12:41,362
alkie, piece of shit like you.

623
01:12:44,152 --> 01:12:46,492
That woman deserved better.

624
01:13:30,572 --> 01:13:31,742
Bill...

625
01:13:33,412 --> 01:13:35,412
...I have some tragic news.

626
01:13:36,542 --> 01:13:38,662
Your brother's dead.

627
01:13:39,462 --> 01:13:41,332
I am so sorry, baby.

628
01:13:42,422 --> 01:13:45,792
She put a black mamba in his camper.

629
01:13:45,882 --> 01:13:48,422
I got her, sweetie.
She's dead.

630
01:13:50,922 --> 01:13:52,722
Let me put it this way:

631
01:13:52,802 --> 01:13:57,142
You ever start feeling sentimental,
go to Barstow, California.

632
01:13:57,222 --> 01:14:01,142
When you get here, walk into a florist
and buy a bunch of flowers.

633
01:14:01,232 --> 01:14:04,152
Take those flowers
to Huntington Cemetery

634
01:14:04,232 --> 01:14:08,402
on Fuller and Guadalupe, look for
the headstone marked "Paula Schultz,"

635
01:14:08,482 --> 01:14:10,612
and lay them on the grave.

636
01:14:10,692 --> 01:14:16,702
'Cause you will be standing at the final
resting place of Beatrix Kiddo.

637
01:14:16,782 --> 01:14:19,242
- Marty Kitrosser?
- Here.

638
01:14:19,332 --> 01:14:20,912
- Melanie Harrhouse?
- Here.

639
01:14:21,002 --> 01:14:23,712
- Beatrix Kiddo?
- Here.

640
01:14:23,792 --> 01:14:27,092
Look... I can be there
in about four hours.

641
01:14:27,172 --> 01:14:28,922
Do you want me to come over?

642
01:14:29,712 --> 01:14:32,722
No, no, no.
You need me, baby, I'm there.

643
01:14:35,802 --> 01:14:38,642
OK. I'm leaving now.

644
01:14:38,722 --> 01:14:41,932
You go smoke some pot or somethin'.
I'll be there soon.

645
01:15:43,372 --> 01:15:45,212
Ugh.

646
01:15:45,292 --> 01:15:46,792
Gross.

647
01:16:58,322 --> 01:16:59,742
Hi-ya!

648
01:17:10,332 --> 01:17:14,752
"To my brother, Budd.
The only man I ever loved. Bill."

649
01:17:26,312 --> 01:17:27,892
What's that?

650
01:17:30,102 --> 01:17:32,602
Budd's Hanzo sword.

651
01:17:32,692 --> 01:17:35,192
He said he pawned it.

652
01:17:35,272 --> 01:17:38,902
Guess that makes him
a liar now, don't it?

653
01:17:42,362 --> 01:17:45,242
- Elle?
- Bea.

654
01:17:46,122 --> 01:17:49,162
Somethin' I've always
been curious about.

655
01:17:49,252 --> 01:17:51,712
Just between us girls...

656
01:17:53,002 --> 01:17:57,502
...what did you say to Pai Mei
to make him snatch out your eye?

657
01:17:57,592 --> 01:18:00,262
<i>Ow!</i>

658
01:18:01,262 --> 01:18:04,512
I called him a miserable old fool.

659
01:18:04,602 --> 01:18:09,642
Ooh. Bad idea.

660
01:18:09,732 --> 01:18:11,522
Know what I did?

661
01:18:12,062 --> 01:18:15,772
I killed that miserable old fool.

662
01:18:17,692 --> 01:18:20,492
How do you like the fish head,
you miserable old fool?

663
01:18:20,572 --> 01:18:23,112
<i>I poisoned his fish heads.</i>

664
01:18:23,202 --> 01:18:26,782
Elle, you treacherous dog.

665
01:18:31,252 --> 01:18:33,832
I - give - you - my - word -

666
01:18:33,922 --> 01:18:35,132
<i>And I told him,</i>

667
01:18:35,212 --> 01:18:39,132
"To me, the word
of an old fool like you

668
01:18:39,212 --> 01:18:41,217
is worth less than nothing."

669
01:18:41,252 --> 01:18:43,222
Is worth less than nothing."

670
01:18:48,062 --> 01:18:49,972
That's right.

671
01:18:50,062 --> 01:18:52,142
I killed your master.

672
01:18:52,232 --> 01:18:54,852
And now I'm gonna kill you, too.

673
01:18:54,942 --> 01:18:57,482
With your own sword, no less.

674
01:18:57,562 --> 01:19:03,242
Which, in the very immediate future,
will become my sword.

675
01:19:05,912 --> 01:19:07,412
Bitch...

676
01:19:08,242 --> 01:19:10,622
...you don't have a future.

677
01:19:58,172 --> 01:20:01,292
Fucking bitch!

678
01:20:03,962 --> 01:20:05,842
Fucking bitch!

679
01:20:14,472 --> 01:20:18,442
I'll kill you!
You're fuckin' dead!

680
01:20:19,312 --> 01:20:23,232
You bitch! You bitch!

681
01:20:27,992 --> 01:20:30,072
I'll fucking kill you, you bitch!

682
01:20:32,622 --> 01:20:35,002
Oh, I'll get you!

683
01:20:37,042 --> 01:20:39,672
I'm gonna...

684
01:20:39,752 --> 01:20:43,042
<i>Where are you?
Lemme fuckin' at you!</i>

685
01:20:45,092 --> 01:20:48,762
Where are you?
I'm coming, you fucking bitch!

686
01:20:48,842 --> 01:20:51,682
You're fucking dead!
You're dead!

687
01:20:53,852 --> 01:20:57,562
Oh... shit!

688
01:22:24,602 --> 01:22:27,322
<i>Like most men
who never knew their father,</i>

689
01:22:27,402 --> 01:22:29,692
<i>Bill collected father figures.</i>

690
01:22:29,782 --> 01:22:32,822
<i>The first was Esteban Vihaio.</i>

691
01:22:32,902 --> 01:22:36,872
<i>Esteban was a pimp
and a friend of Bill's mother.</i>

692
01:22:36,952 --> 01:22:41,002
<i>He ran a brothel in Acuna, Mexico,
for over 50 years.</i>

693
01:22:41,082 --> 01:22:43,542
<i>His army, the Acuna Boys,</i>

694
01:22:43,622 --> 01:22:47,922
<i>made up of the fatherless offspring
of his whores, ran Acuna.</i>

695
01:22:48,002 --> 01:22:50,342
<i>He ran the Acuna Boys.</i>

696
01:22:52,172 --> 01:22:57,102
<i>Now, at the age of 80, it would be
this retired gentleman of leisure</i>

697
01:22:57,182 --> 01:23:00,522
<i>who could point me in Bill's direction.</i>

698
01:23:02,232 --> 01:23:04,352
SeÃ±or Esteban Vihaio?

699
01:23:06,232 --> 01:23:07,562
Yes.

700
01:23:07,652 --> 01:23:09,652
May I join you?

701
01:23:11,692 --> 01:23:14,912
Only on the condition
that you call me Esteban.

702
01:23:14,992 --> 01:23:19,582
- May I join you, Esteban?
- Please.

703
01:23:23,912 --> 01:23:25,172
<i>Americana?</i>

704
01:23:25,252 --> 01:23:26,962
Yes.

705
01:23:27,042 --> 01:23:29,842
I speak a little Spanish, if you prefer.

706
01:23:29,922 --> 01:23:33,422
No, no, no, no.
I prefer English.

707
01:23:33,512 --> 01:23:36,092
I haven't spoken it in a while,

708
01:23:36,182 --> 01:23:39,512
but I would relish
the opportunity to converse

709
01:23:39,602 --> 01:23:42,472
with such a pretty
companion as yourself.

710
01:23:42,562 --> 01:23:46,902
It's my pleasure to be in the company
of such a fine gentleman as yourself.

711
01:23:46,982 --> 01:23:49,772
I must warn you, young lady...

712
01:23:49,862 --> 01:23:53,072
...I am susceptible to flattery.

713
01:23:55,952 --> 01:23:58,112
How may I be of service to you?

714
01:24:06,372 --> 01:24:08,212
Where's Bill?

715
01:24:10,502 --> 01:24:12,842
Ahh.

716
01:24:13,212 --> 01:24:15,342
You must be Beatrix.

717
01:24:17,342 --> 01:24:19,552
I can see the attraction.

718
01:24:22,062 --> 01:24:27,482
I remember when Bill was only
five years old, I took him to the movies.

719
01:24:27,562 --> 01:24:31,232
It was a movie starring Lana Turner.

720
01:24:31,312 --> 01:24:35,532
<i>The Postman Always Ring Twice,
with John Garfields.</i>

721
01:24:36,492 --> 01:24:39,662
And whenever she would
appear on the screen,

722
01:24:39,742 --> 01:24:45,292
Bill would begin compulsively to
suck his thumb to an obscene amount.

723
01:24:45,372 --> 01:24:51,082
And I knew from this very moment,
this boy was a fool for blonds.

724
01:24:56,672 --> 01:24:58,592
Mmm.

725
01:24:58,682 --> 01:25:00,342
You know...

726
01:25:00,432 --> 01:25:04,352
...being a fool for a woman
such as yourself...

727
01:25:04,432 --> 01:25:07,522
...is always the right thing to do.

728
01:25:09,852 --> 01:25:14,692
If we had met when I was
back in business...

729
01:25:14,772 --> 01:25:18,782
...you would have been
my number one lady.

730
01:25:21,782 --> 01:25:26,122
- Well, I'm flattered.
- You goddamn well better be.

731
01:25:27,752 --> 01:25:31,792
This... I heard you were driving a truck.

732
01:25:32,502 --> 01:25:34,542
My Pussy Wagon died on me.

733
01:25:35,422 --> 01:25:37,592
The Pussy died. Hmm.

734
01:25:41,302 --> 01:25:44,182
Bill shot you in the head, no?

735
01:25:44,262 --> 01:25:45,892
- Yes.
- Hmm.

736
01:25:47,972 --> 01:25:51,102
I would have been much nicer.

737
01:25:51,192 --> 01:25:53,612
I would have just cut your face.

738
01:25:56,652 --> 01:25:58,322
You must forgive me.

739
01:25:58,402 --> 01:26:01,202
Please... you have a drink with me.

740
01:26:04,202 --> 01:26:06,332
Clara!

741
01:26:09,832 --> 01:26:11,332
Coming.

742
01:26:14,002 --> 01:26:16,422
<i>Dos aÃ±ejo.</i>

743
01:26:28,852 --> 01:26:30,352
<i>Gracias.</i>

744
01:26:35,562 --> 01:26:38,692
What were we talking about?

745
01:26:44,912 --> 01:26:46,782
Bill.

746
01:26:48,702 --> 01:26:52,622
- Where's Bill?
- Where's Bill?

747
01:26:52,712 --> 01:26:54,462
Yeah. Hmm.

748
01:26:55,332 --> 01:26:59,712
Bill is at the Villa Quatro,
on the road to Salina.

749
01:27:00,882 --> 01:27:03,382
I will draw you a map.

750
01:27:04,802 --> 01:27:07,182
Bill is like a son to me.

751
01:27:08,722 --> 01:27:12,812
- Do you know why I help you?
- No.

752
01:27:12,892 --> 01:27:14,812
Because he would want me to.

753
01:27:16,232 --> 01:27:17,982
Now, that I don't believe.

754
01:27:18,062 --> 01:27:21,032
Ahh.

755
01:27:21,112 --> 01:27:24,902
How else is he ever
going to see you again?

756
01:28:33,812 --> 01:28:35,392
Freeze, Mommy.

757
01:28:35,482 --> 01:28:38,232
Bang, bang! Oh!

758
01:28:38,352 --> 01:28:39,732
Oh! She got us, B.B.

759
01:28:39,812 --> 01:28:42,772
Mommy got us.
Oh, I'm dying!

760
01:28:42,862 --> 01:28:44,902
I'm dying.

761
01:28:47,492 --> 01:28:51,072
Fall down, sweetheart.
Mommy shot us.

762
01:28:52,622 --> 01:28:59,172
But little did Quickdraw Kiddo know
that little B.B. Was only playing possum,

763
01:28:59,252 --> 01:29:04,092
due to the fact that
she was impervious to bullets.

764
01:29:04,172 --> 01:29:06,382
I am pervious to bullets, Mommy.

765
01:29:06,462 --> 01:29:10,092
Hey, get back down there.
You're playing possum.

766
01:29:10,182 --> 01:29:15,932
So, as the smirking killer
advanced on what she thought

767
01:29:16,022 --> 01:29:21,652
was a bullet-ridden corpse,
that's when little B.B. Fired.

768
01:29:23,312 --> 01:29:24,692
Bang, bang!

769
01:29:32,622 --> 01:29:36,832
You're dead, Mommy.
So die.

770
01:29:37,662 --> 01:29:38,962
Oh!

771
01:29:42,132 --> 01:29:43,542
B.B.

772
01:29:47,092 --> 01:29:50,722
Oh! B. B...

773
01:29:53,722 --> 01:29:55,932
I should've known.

774
01:29:56,852 --> 01:29:59,732
You are... the best.

775
01:30:07,112 --> 01:30:10,112
Oh, Mommy.
Don't die.

776
01:30:10,192 --> 01:30:12,322
I was just playing.

777
01:30:17,702 --> 01:30:19,252
I know.

778
01:30:33,222 --> 01:30:35,262
I told her you were asleep...

779
01:30:36,352 --> 01:30:41,142
...but that one day you'd wake up
and come back to her.

780
01:30:41,232 --> 01:30:45,482
And she asked me, "If Mommy's
been asleep since I was born,

781
01:30:45,562 --> 01:30:48,272
then how will she know what I look like?"

782
01:30:48,362 --> 01:30:55,072
To which I replied, "Because
Mommy's been dreaming of you."

783
01:30:55,952 --> 01:30:57,952
That's what I said.

784
01:30:58,952 --> 01:31:02,292
Did you dream of me?
I dreamed of you.

785
01:31:02,372 --> 01:31:06,882
Every single night, baby.
Every single night.

786
01:31:06,962 --> 01:31:11,302
I waited a long time
for you to wake up, Mommy.

787
01:31:22,482 --> 01:31:24,642
Now, let me look at you.

788
01:31:25,942 --> 01:31:28,482
Oh.

789
01:31:31,402 --> 01:31:35,322
My, my, my,
what a pretty little girl you are.

790
01:31:35,412 --> 01:31:37,322
You're pretty too, Mommy.

791
01:31:43,662 --> 01:31:46,962
Tell Mommy what you said
when I showed you her picture.

792
01:31:47,172 --> 01:31:48,422
Mnh-mnh.

793
01:31:48,502 --> 01:31:51,002
- Come on, shy girl.
- Mnh-mnh.

794
01:31:51,092 --> 01:31:53,762
Come on. You know what you said.

795
01:31:53,842 --> 01:31:57,302
Come on. Tell Mommy.
It'll make her feel good. Come on.

796
01:31:59,352 --> 01:32:00,932
- Mnh-mnh.
- Yeah. Come on.

797
01:32:01,012 --> 01:32:03,142
I said... I said,

798
01:32:03,222 --> 01:32:09,362
"You're the most beautifulest woman
I ever saw in the whole wide world."

799
01:32:11,192 --> 01:32:14,992
That's the truth.
That's what she said.

800
01:32:15,072 --> 01:32:21,832
B.B., don't you think Mommy has the
prettiest hair in the whole wide world?

801
01:32:21,912 --> 01:32:27,082
- Yes, I do.
- Matter of fact, it's better than pretty.

802
01:32:27,172 --> 01:32:31,922
- What's better than pretty?
- Mmm... Gorgeous.

803
01:32:32,002 --> 01:32:37,882
Very good. Gorgeous.
Mommy is gorgeous.

804
01:32:38,932 --> 01:32:44,682
Hmm. You know, sweetie,
Mommy's kinda mad at Daddy.

805
01:32:44,772 --> 01:32:47,642
Why, Daddy?
Were you being a bad daddy?

806
01:32:47,732 --> 01:32:51,062
I'm afraid I was.
I was a real bad daddy.

807
01:32:53,692 --> 01:32:57,992
Our little girl learned about
life and death the other day.

808
01:32:58,072 --> 01:33:02,282
Wanna tell Mommy about
what happened to Emilio?

809
01:33:04,242 --> 01:33:06,252
I killed him.

810
01:33:07,252 --> 01:33:11,712
- Emilio was her goldfish.
- Emilio was my goldfish.

811
01:33:12,502 --> 01:33:17,012
She came running into my room,
holding the fish in her hand and crying,

812
01:33:17,092 --> 01:33:20,262
"Daddy. Daddy.
Emilio's dead."

813
01:33:21,932 --> 01:33:25,682
And I said, "Really? That's so sad.

814
01:33:25,772 --> 01:33:28,022
How did he die?"

815
01:33:28,102 --> 01:33:31,442
- And what did you say?
- I stepped on him.

816
01:33:31,522 --> 01:33:36,692
Actually, young lady, the words
you so strategically used were,

817
01:33:36,782 --> 01:33:39,532
"I accidentally stepped on him."

818
01:33:40,822 --> 01:33:42,622
To which I queried,

819
01:33:42,702 --> 01:33:48,252
"And just how did your foot accidentally
find its way into Emilio's fishbowl?"

820
01:33:48,332 --> 01:33:52,672
And she said, "No, no, no. Emilio was
on the carpet when I stepped on him."

821
01:33:52,752 --> 01:33:55,962
Mmm. The plot thickens.

822
01:33:56,672 --> 01:34:01,552
"And just how did Emilio
get on the carpet?"

823
01:34:01,632 --> 01:34:04,892
And, Mommy, you would've been
so proud of her.

824
01:34:07,352 --> 01:34:09,482
She didn't lie.

825
01:34:09,562 --> 01:34:13,732
She said she took Emilio
out of his bowl...

826
01:34:13,812 --> 01:34:16,232
...and put him on the carpet.

827
01:34:18,902 --> 01:34:22,032
And what was Emilio
doing on the carpet?

828
01:34:23,032 --> 01:34:24,912
Flapping.

829
01:34:25,742 --> 01:34:29,912
And then you stomped on him.

830
01:34:30,002 --> 01:34:32,542
And when you lifted up your foot...

831
01:34:33,672 --> 01:34:37,632
...what was Emilio doing then?
- Nothing.

832
01:34:37,712 --> 01:34:40,672
He stopped flapping, didn't he?

833
01:34:43,012 --> 01:34:44,802
She told me later...

834
01:34:45,602 --> 01:34:47,972
...that the second she lifted up her foot

835
01:34:48,062 --> 01:34:52,272
and saw Emilio not flapping,
she knew what she had done.

836
01:34:52,352 --> 01:34:57,402
Is that not the perfect
visual image of life and death?

837
01:34:57,482 --> 01:35:02,822
A fish flapping on the carpet,
and a fish notflapping on the carpet.

838
01:35:04,822 --> 01:35:10,542
So powerful, even a four-year-old
with no concept of life or death...

839
01:35:10,622 --> 01:35:12,412
...knew what it meant.

840
01:35:13,662 --> 01:35:17,292
You loved Emilio, didn't you?

841
01:35:17,382 --> 01:35:20,302
Well... I love Mommy too.

842
01:35:21,842 --> 01:35:24,132
But I did to Mommy
what you did to Emilio.

843
01:35:24,222 --> 01:35:28,052
- You stomped on Mommy?
- Worse.

844
01:35:28,142 --> 01:35:30,182
I shot Mommy.

845
01:35:30,262 --> 01:35:33,432
Not pretend shooting
like we were just doing.

846
01:35:33,522 --> 01:35:35,312
I shot her for real.

847
01:35:35,392 --> 01:35:37,862
Why? Did you want to see
what would happen?

848
01:35:37,942 --> 01:35:42,492
No, I knew what would happen
to Mommy if I shot her.

849
01:35:42,572 --> 01:35:47,202
What I didn't know was, when I shot
Mommy, what would happen to me.

850
01:35:47,282 --> 01:35:51,122
- What happened?
- I was very sad.

851
01:35:53,202 --> 01:35:55,372
And that's when I learned...

852
01:35:55,462 --> 01:36:00,752
...some things, once you do,
they can never be undone.

853
01:36:03,762 --> 01:36:08,932
- What happened to Mommy?
- Why don't you ask Mommy?

854
01:36:09,012 --> 01:36:12,142
You OK, Mommy?
Does it hurt?

855
01:36:12,222 --> 01:36:14,142
No, sweetie.

856
01:36:16,022 --> 01:36:18,022
Doesn't hurt anymore.

857
01:36:24,112 --> 01:36:26,362
Did it make you sick?

858
01:36:27,032 --> 01:36:31,532
No. It made me sleep.

859
01:36:31,622 --> 01:36:34,702
That's why I haven't been with you. B.B.
I've been asleep.

860
01:36:34,792 --> 01:36:37,622
But you're awake now, Mommy. Right?

861
01:36:38,292 --> 01:36:41,592
I'm wide awake, pretty girl.

862
01:36:41,672 --> 01:36:46,922
B.B., would you like Mommy to watch
a video with you before sleepy time?

863
01:36:48,472 --> 01:36:51,972
Mommy, do you want to watch
a video with me before sleepy time?

864
01:36:52,052 --> 01:36:55,062
Oh, yeah!
I would love to.

865
01:36:55,142 --> 01:36:57,852
<i>- Which one do you wanna watch?
- Shogun Assassin.</i>

866
01:36:57,942 --> 01:37:00,352
No, B.B.
Shogun Assassin is too long.

867
01:37:00,442 --> 01:37:04,532
- Mnh-mnh.
- No, it's not.

868
01:37:04,612 --> 01:37:09,322
Well, then, I'll leave you ladies to it.

869
01:37:15,832 --> 01:37:21,292
<i>When I was little,
my father was famous.</i>

870
01:37:21,382 --> 01:37:25,592
<i>He was the greatest samurai
in the empire.</i>

871
01:37:25,672 --> 01:37:28,972
<i>And he was the shogun's decapitator.</i>

872
01:37:29,052 --> 01:37:34,102
<i>He cut off the heads of 131 lords.</i>

873
01:37:34,182 --> 01:37:38,772
<i>My father would come home to Mother
and when he would see her,</i>

874
01:37:38,852 --> 01:37:41,602
<i>he would forget about the killings.</i>

875
01:37:41,692 --> 01:37:46,782
<i>He wasn't scared of the shogun,
but the shogun was scared of him.</i>

876
01:37:46,862 --> 01:37:49,532
<i>Maybe that was the problem.</i>

877
01:37:49,612 --> 01:37:52,492
<i>One night, the shogun sent...</i>

878
01:40:14,212 --> 01:40:17,132
I was just admiring your sword.

879
01:40:18,222 --> 01:40:20,142
Quite a piece of work.

880
01:40:21,472 --> 01:40:25,482
Speaking of which, how is Hanzo-san?

881
01:40:25,562 --> 01:40:27,022
He's good.

882
01:40:29,022 --> 01:40:31,022
Has his sushi gotten any better?

883
01:40:34,822 --> 01:40:39,912
You know, I couldn't believe it.
You got him to make you a sword.

884
01:40:39,992 --> 01:40:44,332
It was easy.
I just dropped your name, Bill.

885
01:40:44,412 --> 01:40:46,502
That'd do it.

886
01:41:17,702 --> 01:41:23,032
I suppose the idea is we cross
Hanzo swords. Am I right?

887
01:41:25,082 --> 01:41:26,662
Well,

888
01:41:26,752 --> 01:41:31,832
it just so happens this hacienda
has its own private beach.

889
01:41:31,922 --> 01:41:36,262
And that private beach just so happens
to look particularly beautiful

890
01:41:36,342 --> 01:41:38,012
bathed in moonlight.

891
01:41:39,342 --> 01:41:42,262
And there just so happens to be
a full moon out tonight.

892
01:41:42,342 --> 01:41:48,932
So, swordfighter, if you want
a swordfight, that's where I suggest.

893
01:41:49,022 --> 01:41:53,192
But if you wanna be old school about it...

894
01:41:53,272 --> 01:41:56,942
...and you know
I'm all about old school...

895
01:41:57,032 --> 01:42:00,702
...then we could wait until dawn
and slice each other up at sunrise

896
01:42:00,782 --> 01:42:02,952
like a couple of real-life honest...

897
01:42:05,162 --> 01:42:10,412
Now, if you don't settle down, I'm gonna
have to put one in your kneecap.

898
01:42:10,502 --> 01:42:13,752
And I hear tell that's
a very painful place to get shot in.

899
01:42:15,842 --> 01:42:20,302
I'm just fuckin' with you.

900
01:42:21,302 --> 01:42:22,762
Now...

901
01:42:23,512 --> 01:42:26,102
...when it comes to you...

902
01:42:26,182 --> 01:42:27,852
...and us...

903
01:42:29,812 --> 01:42:32,982
...I have a few unanswered questions.

904
01:42:33,062 --> 01:42:38,612
So, before this tale of bloody revenge
reaches its climax,

905
01:42:39,612 --> 01:42:44,202
I'm gonna ask you some questions,
and I want you to tell me the truth.

906
01:42:44,952 --> 01:42:47,952
However, therein lies a dilemma.

907
01:42:49,202 --> 01:42:51,792
Because when it comes
to the subject of me,

908
01:42:51,872 --> 01:42:57,092
I believe you are truly and utterly
incapable of telling the truth.

909
01:42:57,172 --> 01:43:01,722
Especially to me.
And least of all, to yourself.

910
01:43:01,802 --> 01:43:05,142
And when it comes to the subject of me,

911
01:43:05,222 --> 01:43:11,932
I am truly and utterly incapable
of believing anything you say.

912
01:43:12,022 --> 01:43:14,232
How do you suppose
we solve this dilemma?

913
01:43:14,312 --> 01:43:15,852
Well,

914
01:43:15,942 --> 01:43:18,152
it just so happens,

915
01:43:18,232 --> 01:43:20,282
I have a solution.

916
01:43:20,362 --> 01:43:22,822
- Aah!
- Gotcha!

917
01:43:22,902 --> 01:43:25,112
<i>Goddamn!</i>

918
01:43:27,572 --> 01:43:30,992
What the fuck
did you just shoot me with?

919
01:43:31,082 --> 01:43:34,832
My greatest invention.
Or at least my favorite.

920
01:43:35,502 --> 01:43:39,462
Don't touch it, or I'll stick another one
right in your cheek.

921
01:43:43,172 --> 01:43:49,432
What lies within that dart, just begging
to course its way through your veins...

922
01:43:49,512 --> 01:43:53,982
...is an incredibly potent
and quite infallible truth serum.

923
01:43:54,062 --> 01:43:57,062
I call it "The Undisputed Truth."

924
01:43:57,152 --> 01:44:01,692
Twice as strong as sodium pentothal,
with no druggie aftereffects.

925
01:44:02,732 --> 01:44:08,622
Except for a slight wave of euphoria.
You feel it?

926
01:44:08,702 --> 01:44:11,242
- Euphoria?
- Yeah.

927
01:44:11,332 --> 01:44:14,712
- No.
- Too bad.

928
01:44:15,832 --> 01:44:18,002
As you know...

929
01:44:18,082 --> 01:44:21,712
...I'm quite keen on comic books.

930
01:44:22,382 --> 01:44:25,302
Especially the ones about superheroes.

931
01:44:25,382 --> 01:44:31,012
I find the whole mythology
surrounding superheroes fascinating.

932
01:44:31,102 --> 01:44:34,732
Take my favorite superhero, Superman.

933
01:44:35,772 --> 01:44:38,852
Not a great comic book.
Not particularly well drawn.

934
01:44:40,442 --> 01:44:41,442
Mmm.

935
01:44:42,232 --> 01:44:44,612
But the mythology...

936
01:44:44,692 --> 01:44:48,112
The mythology is not only great,
it's unique.

937
01:44:48,782 --> 01:44:52,412
How long does this shit take
to go into effect?

938
01:44:52,492 --> 01:44:56,372
About two minutes. Just long enough
for me to finish my point.

939
01:44:56,462 --> 01:45:01,672
Now, a staple of the superhero
mythology is,

940
01:45:01,752 --> 01:45:04,712
there's the superhero
and there's the alter ego.

941
01:45:04,802 --> 01:45:09,092
Batman is actually Bruce Wayne,
Spider-Man is actually Peter Parker.

942
01:45:10,142 --> 01:45:14,102
When that character wakes up
in the morning, he's Peter Parker.

943
01:45:14,182 --> 01:45:18,692
He has to put on a costume
to become Spider-Man.

944
01:45:19,352 --> 01:45:25,232
And it is in that characteristic
Superman stands alone.

945
01:45:25,322 --> 01:45:28,112
Superman didn't become Superman.

946
01:45:28,202 --> 01:45:30,782
Superman was born Superman.

947
01:45:30,862 --> 01:45:34,372
When Superman wakes up
in the morning, he's Superman.

948
01:45:35,372 --> 01:45:37,962
His alter ego is Clark Kent.

949
01:45:38,832 --> 01:45:41,962
His outfit with the big red "S" -

950
01:45:42,042 --> 01:45:45,752
that's the blanket he was wrapped in
as a baby when the Kents found him.

951
01:45:45,842 --> 01:45:48,262
<i>Those are his clothes.</i>

952
01:45:48,802 --> 01:45:54,052
What Kent wears - the glasses,
the business suit - that's the costume.

953
01:45:54,142 --> 01:45:58,642
That's the costume Superman wears
to blend in with us.

954
01:46:00,312 --> 01:46:03,812
Clark Kent is how Superman views us.

955
01:46:03,902 --> 01:46:07,072
And what are the characteristics
of Clark Kent?

956
01:46:07,152 --> 01:46:08,692
He's weak...

957
01:46:09,652 --> 01:46:12,452
...he's unsure of himself...

958
01:46:12,532 --> 01:46:14,322
...he's a coward.

959
01:46:15,332 --> 01:46:20,412
Clark Kent is Superman's critique
on the whole human race.

960
01:46:22,172 --> 01:46:26,842
Sort of like Beatrix Kiddo
and Mrs. Tommy Plimpton.

961
01:46:27,882 --> 01:46:30,092
<i>Aso.</i>

962
01:46:30,172 --> 01:46:32,512
The point emerges.

963
01:46:34,182 --> 01:46:37,682
You would've worn the costume
of Arlene Plimpton.

964
01:46:37,762 --> 01:46:40,642
But you were born Beatrix Kiddo.

965
01:46:41,642 --> 01:46:46,772
And every morning when you woke up,
you'd still be Beatrix Kiddo.

966
01:46:46,862 --> 01:46:48,862
Oh, you can... take the needle out.

967
01:46:56,122 --> 01:46:58,452
Are you calling me a superhero?

968
01:46:58,542 --> 01:47:00,042
I'm calling you a killer.

969
01:47:00,702 --> 01:47:03,622
A natural born killer.

970
01:47:03,712 --> 01:47:07,382
You always have been,
and you always will be.

971
01:47:07,462 --> 01:47:09,592
Moving to El Paso...

972
01:47:09,672 --> 01:47:13,052
...working in a used record store...

973
01:47:13,132 --> 01:47:15,802
...goin' to the movies with Tommy...

974
01:47:15,892 --> 01:47:17,352
...clipping coupons.

975
01:47:17,432 --> 01:47:19,262
That's you...

976
01:47:19,352 --> 01:47:22,772
...trying to disguise yourself
as a worker bee.

977
01:47:22,852 --> 01:47:25,902
That's you tryin' to blend in with the hive.

978
01:47:25,982 --> 01:47:28,112
But you're not a worker bee.

979
01:47:29,362 --> 01:47:32,072
You're a renegade killer bee.

980
01:47:32,152 --> 01:47:35,282
And no matter how much beer you drank
or barbecue you ate

981
01:47:35,362 --> 01:47:38,412
or how fat your ass got,

982
01:47:38,492 --> 01:47:42,412
nothing in the world
would ever change that.

983
01:47:44,792 --> 01:47:46,582
First question:

984
01:47:48,962 --> 01:47:53,632
Did you really think your life in El Paso
was gonna work?

985
01:48:00,062 --> 01:48:01,772
No!

986
01:48:05,312 --> 01:48:08,362
But I would've had B.B.!

987
01:48:08,442 --> 01:48:11,022
Don't get me wrong.

988
01:48:11,112 --> 01:48:15,032
I think you would have been
a wonderful mother.

989
01:48:15,112 --> 01:48:17,202
But you are a killer.

990
01:48:21,792 --> 01:48:24,452
All those people you killed to get to me...

991
01:48:24,542 --> 01:48:27,122
...felt damn good, didn't they?

992
01:48:29,212 --> 01:48:30,882
Yes.

993
01:48:31,802 --> 01:48:34,212
Every single one of them?

994
01:48:44,312 --> 01:48:46,142
Yes.

995
01:48:49,482 --> 01:48:52,022
That was the warmup round.

996
01:48:52,112 --> 01:48:56,782
Now comes the $64,000 question.

997
01:49:04,122 --> 01:49:07,832
Why did you run away
from me with my baby?

998
01:49:11,672 --> 01:49:15,092
Do you remember the last assignment
you sent me on?

999
01:49:15,172 --> 01:49:16,882
Of course.

1000
01:49:17,632 --> 01:49:19,682
Lisa Wong.

1001
01:49:20,932 --> 01:49:23,722
The morning I left, I was sick.

1002
01:49:25,272 --> 01:49:28,352
On the plane, I threw up.

1003
01:49:29,692 --> 01:49:32,192
So I started thinking:

1004
01:49:33,612 --> 01:49:35,822
Maybe I was pregnant.

1005
01:49:35,902 --> 01:49:41,242
"Easy to use. Remove cap and urinate
on the absorbent end for five seconds.

1006
01:49:42,532 --> 01:49:45,042
"Accurate results in only 90 seconds.

1007
01:49:45,122 --> 01:49:48,582
You can read the results as soon as
the line appears in the window."

1008
01:50:24,822 --> 01:50:25,832
Fuck.

1009
01:50:25,912 --> 01:50:28,122
<i>What I didn't know...</i>

1010
01:50:28,202 --> 01:50:32,332
<i>... was that somewhere on my journey
I had been spotted.</i>

1011
01:50:32,422 --> 01:50:38,592
<i>With me in L.A., it didn't take Lisa Wong
long to send an assassin of her own.</i>

1012
01:50:39,762 --> 01:50:41,262
Hello, can I help you?

1013
01:50:41,342 --> 01:50:44,802
Hello, I'm Karen Kim.
I'm the hospitality manager of the hotel.

1014
01:50:44,892 --> 01:50:46,892
I have a welcome gift
from the management.

1015
01:50:46,972 --> 01:50:48,222
Oh, that's nice. Um...

1016
01:50:49,602 --> 01:50:51,272
Can you just leave it by the door?

1017
01:51:03,782 --> 01:51:07,662
- You pretty good with that shotgun?
- Not that I have to be at this range,

1018
01:51:07,742 --> 01:51:09,622
but I'm a fuckin' surgeon
with this shotgun.

1019
01:51:09,702 --> 01:51:12,752
Well, guess what, bitch?
I'm better than Annie Oakley.

1020
01:51:12,832 --> 01:51:16,212
- And I got you right in my sight.
- I could blow your fuckin' head off.

1021
01:51:16,292 --> 01:51:20,462
Not before I put one
right between your eyes, so let's talk.

1022
01:51:22,172 --> 01:51:23,972
Karen...

1023
01:51:26,182 --> 01:51:28,602
...I just found out...

1024
01:51:28,682 --> 01:51:30,522
...right now...

1025
01:51:30,602 --> 01:51:34,852
...not a moment before
you blew a hole through the door...

1026
01:51:36,652 --> 01:51:40,902
...that I'm pregnant.
- What is this?

1027
01:51:40,982 --> 01:51:43,362
On the floor by the door...

1028
01:51:43,452 --> 01:51:47,122
...is a strip that says I'm pregnant.

1029
01:51:47,202 --> 01:51:48,372
Bullshit.

1030
01:51:49,492 --> 01:51:53,042
Any other time
you'd be 100 percent right.

1031
01:51:53,122 --> 01:51:54,962
This time...

1032
01:51:56,542 --> 01:51:58,342
...you're 100 percent wrong.

1033
01:52:00,382 --> 01:52:03,302
I'm the deadliest woman in the world.

1034
01:52:04,302 --> 01:52:06,432
But right now...

1035
01:52:06,512 --> 01:52:09,182
...I'm just scared shitless for my baby.

1036
01:52:09,972 --> 01:52:11,642
Please.

1037
01:52:13,182 --> 01:52:15,562
Just look at the strip.

1038
01:52:17,562 --> 01:52:19,362
Please.

1039
01:52:20,652 --> 01:52:25,362
Stay where you are and don't move.

1040
01:52:42,552 --> 01:52:44,512
I don't know what this fuckin' shit means.

1041
01:52:44,592 --> 01:52:46,552
The box with the directions -
it's right there.

1042
01:52:59,062 --> 01:53:00,862
"Easy to use.

1043
01:53:00,942 --> 01:53:05,492
Remove the cap and urinate
on the absorbent end."

1044
01:53:05,572 --> 01:53:07,202
Blue means pregnant.

1045
01:53:07,282 --> 01:53:10,032
I'll read it myself, thank you.

1046
01:53:17,832 --> 01:53:19,542
Oh, OK.

1047
01:53:19,622 --> 01:53:21,502
Say I were to believe you.
What then?

1048
01:53:21,582 --> 01:53:23,632
Just go home.

1049
01:53:25,922 --> 01:53:28,092
I'll do the same.

1050
01:53:47,612 --> 01:53:49,282
Congratulations.

1051
01:53:52,872 --> 01:53:55,662
<i>Before that strip turned blue...</i>

1052
01:53:55,742 --> 01:53:58,202
...I was a woman, I was your woman.

1053
01:53:59,212 --> 01:54:02,462
I was a killer who killed for you.

1054
01:54:02,542 --> 01:54:06,002
Before that strip turned blue,
I would've jumped a motorcycle

1055
01:54:06,092 --> 01:54:08,132
onto a speeding train.

1056
01:54:09,132 --> 01:54:10,882
For you.

1057
01:54:12,472 --> 01:54:15,892
But once that strip turned blue...

1058
01:54:15,972 --> 01:54:19,352
...I could no longer do
any of those things.

1059
01:54:19,432 --> 01:54:21,902
Not anymore.

1060
01:54:21,982 --> 01:54:24,362
Because I was gonna be a mother.

1061
01:54:27,572 --> 01:54:29,492
Can you understand that?

1062
01:54:32,572 --> 01:54:34,242
Yes.

1063
01:54:35,242 --> 01:54:37,452
But why didn't you...

1064
01:54:37,542 --> 01:54:39,832
...tell me then, instead of now?

1065
01:54:40,832 --> 01:54:43,122
Once you knew, you'd claim her.

1066
01:54:43,212 --> 01:54:45,172
And I didn't want that.

1067
01:54:45,922 --> 01:54:48,132
Not your decision to make.

1068
01:54:48,212 --> 01:54:50,262
Yes.

1069
01:54:50,342 --> 01:54:53,682
But it's the right decision,
and I made it for my daughter.

1070
01:54:54,682 --> 01:54:58,392
She deserved to be born
with a clean slate.

1071
01:54:59,392 --> 01:55:01,392
But with you...

1072
01:55:01,482 --> 01:55:05,362
...she would've been born
into a world she shouldn't have.

1073
01:55:07,072 --> 01:55:09,282
I had to choose.

1074
01:55:10,492 --> 01:55:12,492
I chose her.

1075
01:55:14,952 --> 01:55:17,742
You know, five years ago,

1076
01:55:17,832 --> 01:55:22,662
if I had to make a list of impossible
things that could never happen,

1077
01:55:22,752 --> 01:55:27,882
you performing a coup de grÃ¢ce on me
by bustin' a cap in my crown...

1078
01:55:30,882 --> 01:55:33,512
...would've been right
at the top of the list.

1079
01:55:35,182 --> 01:55:37,262
I'd have been wrong, wouldn't I?

1080
01:55:38,512 --> 01:55:40,352
I- I'm sorry.

1081
01:55:40,432 --> 01:55:42,522
Was that a question?

1082
01:55:43,852 --> 01:55:46,352
Of impossible things
that could never happen -

1083
01:55:46,442 --> 01:55:49,902
yes, in this instance
you would've been wrong.

1084
01:55:50,402 --> 01:55:51,822
Well?

1085
01:55:51,902 --> 01:55:55,452
When you never came back,

1086
01:55:55,532 --> 01:56:01,622
I naturally assumed Lisa Wong,
or somebody else, had killed you.

1087
01:56:01,702 --> 01:56:05,002
Oh! And for the record...

1088
01:56:05,082 --> 01:56:09,252
...letting somebody think somebody
they love is dead when they're not

1089
01:56:09,342 --> 01:56:11,212
is quite cruel.

1090
01:56:14,762 --> 01:56:18,682
I mourned you for three months.

1091
01:56:19,472 --> 01:56:22,772
And in the third month of mourning you...

1092
01:56:23,892 --> 01:56:26,192
...I tracked you down.

1093
01:56:26,272 --> 01:56:28,482
I wasn't tryin' to track you down.

1094
01:56:28,562 --> 01:56:32,902
I was tryin' to track down
the fucking assholes I thought killed you.

1095
01:56:34,032 --> 01:56:35,902
So I find you...

1096
01:56:37,572 --> 01:56:39,822
...and what do I find?

1097
01:56:39,912 --> 01:56:43,162
Not only are you not dead...

1098
01:56:43,242 --> 01:56:47,462
...you're getting married
to some fucking jerk.

1099
01:56:49,542 --> 01:56:52,002
And you're pregnant.

1100
01:56:55,382 --> 01:56:57,932
I overreacted.

1101
01:57:06,522 --> 01:57:10,362
You overreacted?
Is that your explanation?

1102
01:57:10,442 --> 01:57:12,942
I didn't say I was gonna explain myself.

1103
01:57:13,022 --> 01:57:15,322
I said I was gonna tell you the truth.

1104
01:57:15,402 --> 01:57:20,202
But if that's too cryptic, let's get literal.

1105
01:57:22,202 --> 01:57:23,872
I'm a killer.

1106
01:57:24,872 --> 01:57:27,372
I'm a murdering bastard.
You know that.

1107
01:57:28,292 --> 01:57:31,212
And there are consequences...

1108
01:57:31,292 --> 01:57:34,672
...to breaking the heart
of a murdering bastard.

1109
01:57:35,672 --> 01:57:38,172
You experienced some of them.

1110
01:57:41,762 --> 01:57:45,432
Was my reaction really that surprising?

1111
01:57:45,522 --> 01:57:49,562
Yes. It was.

1112
01:57:51,522 --> 01:57:55,272
Could you do what you did?

1113
01:57:55,362 --> 01:57:57,402
Of course you could.

1114
01:57:59,202 --> 01:58:05,702
But I never thought you would,
or could, do that to me.

1115
01:58:05,792 --> 01:58:08,712
I'm really sorry, Kiddo...

1116
01:58:08,792 --> 01:58:11,042
...but you thought wrong.

1117
01:58:17,212 --> 01:58:21,432
You and I have unfinished business.

1118
01:58:22,222 --> 01:58:25,602
Baby... you ain't kiddin'.

1119
01:58:58,592 --> 01:59:04,092
Pai Mei taught you the Five-Point-Palm
Exploding-Heart Technique?

1120
01:59:07,102 --> 01:59:09,432
'Course he did.

1121
01:59:11,182 --> 01:59:13,312
Why didn't you tell me?

1122
01:59:17,072 --> 01:59:19,282
I don't know.

1123
01:59:21,532 --> 01:59:23,362
Because I'm...

1124
01:59:24,452 --> 01:59:26,622
...a bad person.

1125
01:59:27,662 --> 01:59:29,332
No.

1126
01:59:31,292 --> 01:59:34,372
You're not a bad person.

1127
01:59:34,462 --> 01:59:37,382
You're a terrific person.

1128
01:59:37,462 --> 01:59:40,802
You're my favorite person.

1129
01:59:41,962 --> 01:59:44,932
But every once in a while...

1130
01:59:45,932 --> 01:59:47,892
...you can be a real cunt.

1131
02:00:07,492 --> 02:00:09,452
How do I look?

1132
02:00:25,012 --> 02:00:27,592
You look ready.

1133
02:02:14,242 --> 02:02:18,452
<i>Well, well, well.
If it ain't the little flower.</i>

1134
02:02:23,292 --> 02:02:26,752
<i>Good evening, Mr. And Mrs.
America and all the ships at sea.</i>

1135
02:02:26,842 --> 02:02:28,882
<i>Let's go to press. Flash.</i>

1136
02:02:28,972 --> 02:02:31,682
<i>Do you have a magpie in your home?</i>

1137
02:02:31,762 --> 02:02:34,102
<i>If you do, you are most fortunate.</i>

1138
02:02:34,182 --> 02:02:37,772
<i>The magpie is the most
charming bird in all the world.</i>

1139
02:02:37,852 --> 02:02:40,392
<i>He is the best friend a farmer ever had.</i>

1140
02:02:40,482 --> 02:02:43,522
<i>Treat him gently.
Treat him kindly.</i>

1141
02:02:43,602 --> 02:02:48,112
<i>And always remember,
the magpie deserves your respect.</i>

1142
02:03:24,022 --> 02:03:25,402
Thank you.

1143
02:03:26,652 --> 02:03:29,482
Thank you.
Thank you.

1144
02:03:30,902 --> 02:03:32,902
Oh, thank you.

1145
02:03:35,112 --> 02:03:37,162
<i>Now, I'll tell you what
I'm gonna do.</i>

1146
02:03:37,242 --> 02:03:39,792
<i>I ain't got no headache.</i>

1147
02:03:39,872 --> 02:03:42,872
<i>Oh yes, you have, brother.</i>

1148
02:16:47,162 --> 02:16:48,992
<i>And, action!</i>

1149
02:16:51,832 --> 02:16:53,292
<i>Cut.</i>

1150
02:16:53,912 --> 02:16:56,002
Oh, come on.
Let's do it again.
