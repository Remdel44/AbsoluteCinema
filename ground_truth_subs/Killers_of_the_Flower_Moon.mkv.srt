00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:05,127
Tomorrow we will bury this one.

3
00:01:05,544 --> 00:01:11,759
This Pipe Person.

4
00:01:15,471 --> 00:01:19,850
Our messenger to Wah-kon-tah.

5
00:01:20,893 --> 00:01:26,148
It is time to bury this Pipe
with dignity...

6
00:01:26,398 --> 00:01:30,569
...and put away its teachings.

7
00:01:31,278 --> 00:01:34,448
The children outside listening...

8
00:01:35,908 --> 00:01:38,911
...they will learn another language.

9
00:01:40,162 --> 00:01:43,582
They will be taught by white people.

10
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:51,131
They will learn new ways...

11
00:01:51,674 --> 00:01:56,136
...and will not know our ways.

12
00:05:15,509 --> 00:05:17,709
Phillips Oil workmen,
right here.

13
00:05:17,772 --> 00:05:19,774
Kraceon Oil
pipeline crew, over here.

14
00:05:19,948 --> 00:05:21,515
Burbank Oil Field, over here.

15
00:05:21,515 --> 00:05:22,994
Marland Oil!

16
00:05:23,168 --> 00:05:24,909
Rock hounds
for Phillips Oil, this truck.

17
00:05:24,909 --> 00:05:30,350
Make it rich. You can make it
rich. Make it rich. Right here.

18
00:05:47,889 --> 00:05:49,325
Phillips Oil workmen!

19
00:06:10,433 --> 00:06:11,521
Ernest!

20
00:06:12,348 --> 00:06:13,349
Yeah.

21
00:06:13,523 --> 00:06:14,916
- Ernest Burkhart?
- Henry. - Yeah.

22
00:06:15,090 --> 00:06:16,483
Henry Roan.

23
00:06:16,657 --> 00:06:18,136
- I'm taking you to your uncle Hale.
- All right.

24
00:06:18,136 --> 00:06:19,776
Come on. Let's go.
This is us, right here.

25
00:06:19,790 --> 00:06:20,965
Come on, stop!

26
00:06:55,043 --> 00:06:56,523
Whose land is this, Henry?

27
00:06:57,698 --> 00:06:58,873
My land.

28
00:07:00,135 --> 00:07:01,266
My land.

29
00:07:29,077 --> 00:07:33,037
Well, well, well.
Our war hero has arrived.

30
00:07:34,648 --> 00:07:36,780
Welcome home, Ernest.
Welcome home.

31
00:07:36,954 --> 00:07:38,608
It's so good to see you again.

32
00:07:38,782 --> 00:07:40,480
I'm so glad you made it.

33
00:07:40,654 --> 00:07:42,394
Brother.

34
00:07:42,569 --> 00:07:44,919
- Thanks for writin', huh?
- Good to have you back, Brother.

35
00:07:44,919 --> 00:07:47,835
Ernest, now, here's your aunt
Myrtle and your cousin, little Willie.

36
00:07:48,009 --> 00:07:49,609
Welcome. It's so good
to see you.

37
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:51,870
Look how big she's grown.
Isn't that something?

38
00:07:59,499 --> 00:08:02,502
Now, this is a cattle ranch.
There's no oil here.

39
00:08:02,676 --> 00:08:08,159
No oil? Yeah. No oil, no fear,
so I'm settled with no fear.

40
00:08:08,333 --> 00:08:11,685
Time will run out.
This wealth will run dry,

41
00:08:11,859 --> 00:08:15,906
drier than the seven years of famine
that plagued the pharaohs of old.

42
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,952
They're a sick people.

43
00:08:18,126 --> 00:08:21,172
They're kindly people, big-hearted
people, but they're sickly.

44
00:08:23,131 --> 00:08:25,742
What about you?
You see bloodshed?

45
00:08:26,613 --> 00:08:28,658
- Some.
- Mm-hmm.

46
00:08:28,832 --> 00:08:32,706
Well, I was a... I was a
cook in... in the infantry.

47
00:08:34,272 --> 00:08:35,883
You see Kelsie Morrison?
He was over there.

48
00:08:35,883 --> 00:08:37,667
- I did.
- Yeah.

49
00:08:37,841 --> 00:08:40,321
Otis Griggs and the others,
if... if you remember.

50
00:08:40,322 --> 00:08:44,587
Soldiers have to eat. You fed
the soldiers that won the war.

51
00:08:44,761 --> 00:08:48,417
- Well, saw more die from the flu, but...
- Mmm.

52
00:08:48,591 --> 00:08:50,027
So what happened
to your stomach?

53
00:08:50,201 --> 00:08:53,596
My... My gut, it burst.

54
00:08:53,770 --> 00:08:56,164
You almost lost your life.

55
00:08:56,338 --> 00:09:00,734
They gave me a belt and told me
not to do any heavy lifting.

56
00:09:02,039 --> 00:09:04,399
Well, you made a good choice
coming back here, 'cause here...

57
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:05,520
I know.

58
00:09:05,608 --> 00:09:07,610
Money flows freely here, now.

59
00:09:07,784 --> 00:09:10,874
Well, I do...
I do love that money, sir.

60
00:09:12,267 --> 00:09:13,267
Don't call me "sir."

61
00:09:13,398 --> 00:09:14,835
You call me "Uncle,"

62
00:09:15,009 --> 00:09:17,577
or call me "King," like
you used to. Remember?

63
00:09:17,751 --> 00:09:19,361
- Call you "King"?
- Yeah.

64
00:09:21,537 --> 00:09:23,060
King.

65
00:09:23,234 --> 00:09:26,455
Now, you didn't pick up
any disease over there, did you?

66
00:09:26,629 --> 00:09:28,239
- No. No.
- Sure?

67
00:09:28,413 --> 00:09:29,893
I'm sure, sir. I'm sure.

68
00:09:30,067 --> 00:09:32,548
Not that I know of.

69
00:09:33,636 --> 00:09:35,276
You keep that thing
wrapped up over there?

70
00:09:35,333 --> 00:09:37,118
- I did. I did.
- Mmm.

71
00:09:37,292 --> 00:09:39,337
- As best you could.
- As best I could.

72
00:09:41,426 --> 00:09:42,471
Yeah.

73
00:09:43,951 --> 00:09:45,517
You like women?

74
00:09:45,692 --> 00:09:50,348
Ah, you know I like women.
That's my weakness.

75
00:09:50,522 --> 00:09:52,089
What kinds they got out there?

76
00:09:52,263 --> 00:09:54,962
- Just white.
- Just white, that I saw. - Hmm.

77
00:09:56,659 --> 00:09:57,704
You like red?

78
00:09:57,878 --> 00:09:58,966
Red?

79
00:10:00,141 --> 00:10:01,882
- You mean - that kind of red?
- Mm-hmm.

80
00:10:03,057 --> 00:10:05,625
I like red. I like white.
I like blue.

81
00:10:05,799 --> 00:10:07,496
I like all of 'em.

82
00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:10,934
- Don't matter to me. I'm greedy.
- Mmm.

83
00:10:11,108 --> 00:10:16,070
I... I like the heavy ones. I like
the heavy ones, pretty ones, soft,

84
00:10:16,897 --> 00:10:19,029
ones that smell good, you know.

85
00:10:19,203 --> 00:10:23,077
Well, we gotta keep an eye
on you. You're all over the place.

86
00:10:24,426 --> 00:10:25,775
Uh, speaking of that...

87
00:10:27,081 --> 00:10:28,125
Hey, Byron.

88
00:10:31,346 --> 00:10:32,390
Yeah.

89
00:10:34,654 --> 00:10:36,873
Oh, yeah, that's good.
That's... That's real good.

90
00:10:37,047 --> 00:10:40,094
Don't get played out in the open
with alcohol, you hear?

91
00:10:41,399 --> 00:10:43,184
'Cause then
you'll cause trouble.

92
00:10:44,054 --> 00:10:45,969
- Right, Byron?
- That's right, King.

93
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:49,233
- Mmm.
- No, sir. I w... I won't. I won't.

94
00:10:49,407 --> 00:10:51,714
Now, most fellas out here
are crooked.

95
00:10:51,888 --> 00:10:55,936
Some do things right, most
do bad, so don't be simple.

96
00:10:56,110 --> 00:10:59,026
- No, sir. I won't.
- Don't make small trouble about nothing.

97
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,332
You gonna make trouble,
make it big.

98
00:11:01,506 --> 00:11:03,857
Get a big payoff for that,
you hear?

99
00:11:04,031 --> 00:11:05,685
Yes, sir.

100
00:11:05,859 --> 00:11:09,079
You see, I am officially
reserve deputy sheriff in Fairfax.

101
00:11:11,778 --> 00:11:13,475
I don't want to bring
unwanted eyes.

102
00:11:13,649 --> 00:11:15,520
- I won't find that trouble.
- Yeah.

103
00:11:15,695 --> 00:11:17,435
I won't do stupid things.

104
00:11:17,609 --> 00:11:19,655
And you got your head on
straight after being over there?

105
00:11:19,655 --> 00:11:24,616
Course I do. I'm not... I'm not
thick, sir. I'm... I'm... I'm strong.

106
00:11:24,791 --> 00:11:27,532
Well, I got a place
I'm gonna put you.

107
00:11:27,707 --> 00:11:29,273
- That'll be driving.
- Mmm.

108
00:11:29,447 --> 00:11:31,798
'Cause you can't do much else
'cause of your gut.

109
00:11:32,668 --> 00:11:34,235
You don't read much, do you?

110
00:11:34,801 --> 00:11:35,845
Read?

111
00:11:36,019 --> 00:11:37,629
Do you read, yeah. Read much?

112
00:11:38,674 --> 00:11:39,719
Well, I can read.

113
00:11:39,893 --> 00:11:41,546
Eh. Well,
you smarten yourself up.

114
00:11:41,721 --> 00:11:44,332
Get him that book
on the Osage, Byron.

115
00:11:44,506 --> 00:11:45,942
- This one?
- Yeah, that one.

116
00:11:47,117 --> 00:11:49,772
- You smarten yourself up.
- I... I can read, sir.

117
00:11:49,946 --> 00:11:55,865
The Osage.
They have the worst land possible...

118
00:11:56,039 --> 00:11:59,913
...but the good Lord,
he outsmarted everybody.

119
00:12:00,087 --> 00:12:03,220
The land had oil on it.
Black gold.

120
00:12:04,308 --> 00:12:06,528
But they're wise people.

121
00:12:06,702 --> 00:12:12,490
They worked it so as they had the say
who gets the oil, who gets the headrights.

122
00:12:13,404 --> 00:12:14,797
The Osage are sharp.

123
00:12:17,017 --> 00:12:19,541
They don't talk much,
so that might make you feel

124
00:12:19,715 --> 00:12:21,715
like you've got to run
your mouth to fill the space,

125
00:12:21,848 --> 00:12:23,545
especially you been drinking.

126
00:12:23,719 --> 00:12:27,114
Better you be quiet if you
don't got nothing smart to say.

127
00:12:27,288 --> 00:12:28,811
Don't get caught on that.

128
00:12:28,985 --> 00:12:31,683
It's what they call,
"blackbird talk."

129
00:12:38,125 --> 00:12:39,213
Blackbird talk.

130
00:12:44,348 --> 00:12:46,002
Just 'cause they're not talking,

131
00:12:46,176 --> 00:12:49,092
don't mean they don't know
everything about everything.

132
00:12:49,266 --> 00:12:53,575
Yeah, Osage are the finest and
most beautiful people on God's earth.

133
00:13:13,421 --> 00:13:17,207
<i>John Whitehair, age 23.</i>

134
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:22,212
<i>No investigation.</i>

135
00:13:24,475 --> 00:13:27,696
<i>Bill Stepson, age 29.</i>

136
00:13:30,394 --> 00:13:32,135

00:13:36,618 --> 00:13:39,534
<i>Anna Sanford, age 41.</i>

138
00:13:43,538 --> 00:13:45,018
<i>No investigation.</i>

139
00:13:47,759 --> 00:13:48,848
<i>Rose Lewis...</i>

140
00:13:51,981 --> 00:13:53,548
<i>age 25.</i>

141
00:13:57,552 --> 00:13:59,075
<i>No investigation.</i>

142
00:14:05,212 --> 00:14:06,430
There we go.

143
00:14:21,576 --> 00:14:25,188
<i>And Sara Butler, age 21.</i>

144
00:14:26,581 --> 00:14:27,756
<i>Suicide.</i>

145
00:14:30,193 --> 00:14:31,499
State your name.

146
00:14:32,282 --> 00:14:35,851
I'm Mollie Kyle. Incompetent.

147
00:14:36,678 --> 00:14:38,288
What is your allotment number?

148
00:14:38,462 --> 00:14:39,637
Two hundred eighty-five.

149
00:14:40,725 --> 00:14:45,121
You've asked for
additional moneys of $752

150
00:14:45,295 --> 00:14:48,168
to pay a medical bill
for an abscess.

151
00:14:49,082 --> 00:14:50,474
Yes, sir.

152
00:14:50,648 --> 00:14:52,824
Was the operation successful?

153
00:14:53,869 --> 00:14:54,914
Yes, sir.

154
00:14:55,088 --> 00:14:57,307
And the diabetes?

155
00:14:57,481 --> 00:15:02,095
I have a prescription at Fairfax Drugs.
I'll send my help to fill twice monthly.

156
00:15:02,269 --> 00:15:04,662
You gotta look out for that,
you know.

157
00:15:07,404 --> 00:15:10,233
Now, Mollie, it's your mother.

158
00:15:10,407 --> 00:15:15,499
You know she's restricted too, so
we have to account for every penny.

159
00:15:17,197 --> 00:15:23,159
It says here she spent
$319 and 05 cents for meat

160
00:15:24,465 --> 00:15:25,857
at the grocery.

161
00:15:27,294 --> 00:15:30,993
Don't you think that's an awful
lot of meat for what she needs?

162
00:15:32,647 --> 00:15:34,083
Yes, Mr. Beaty.

163
00:15:34,257 --> 00:15:37,826
Well, you'll look after that,
won't you?

164
00:15:40,350 --> 00:15:41,351
Yes.

165
00:15:45,573 --> 00:15:49,185
All right, people. Let's form a
line here for allotment payments.

166
00:15:49,359 --> 00:15:51,361
Unrestricted only.

167
00:15:51,535 --> 00:15:55,757
Restricted, take your guardian. He
has to be with you to sign your checks.

168
00:15:55,931 --> 00:15:58,890
You need to find your guardian.
Nothing new this time, folks.

169
00:15:59,065 --> 00:16:00,936
Thirty-dollar photo
for posterity.

170
00:16:01,110 --> 00:16:03,373
Don't you wanna preserve
your family history? Come on.

171
00:16:03,547 --> 00:16:05,467
How about you, sir? You... Now,
don't go after him.

172
00:16:05,549 --> 00:16:07,943
He don't know nothing.
He's an amateur.

173
00:16:08,117 --> 00:16:11,294
You need a proper photo
for you and your family.

174
00:16:11,468 --> 00:16:14,732
For you, sir? $40.
For you, sir? $40.

175
00:16:14,906 --> 00:16:16,256
How much? $40?$40.

176
00:16:16,430 --> 00:16:18,432
All right. I got $35
cash for you right now.

177
00:16:18,606 --> 00:16:20,406
- Take it or leave it.
- Thirty-five's a deal.

178
00:16:20,477 --> 00:16:21,739
Let's have it, get it done.

179
00:16:21,913 --> 00:16:23,437
Y'all are gonna make
a pretty picture.

180
00:16:23,611 --> 00:16:25,134
Y'all, come on this way,
over here.

181
00:16:37,755 --> 00:16:41,629
My wife's been feeling poorly.
The doctor says it's her constitution.

182
00:16:41,803 --> 00:16:43,413
The boy's got asthma.

183
00:16:43,587 --> 00:16:46,025
His asthma's holding him back.
He just needs a chance.

184
00:16:46,199 --> 00:16:49,028
You've got your checks.
You're unrestricted. Please.

185
00:16:54,424 --> 00:16:56,383
We'll take one. In that color.

186
00:16:56,557 --> 00:16:59,777
- Thank you.
- Thank you!

187
00:16:59,951 --> 00:17:02,476
I'll tell you what, you run
out of gas, you get a flat tire,

188
00:17:02,650 --> 00:17:04,304
you come right on back
and buy another.

189
00:17:25,238 --> 00:17:27,838
Ma'am, you need a ride?
That's my bucket, right there.

190
00:17:27,936 --> 00:17:29,155
Thank you.

191
00:17:31,331 --> 00:17:34,290
Gotta be careful. A lot of
characters around here today.

192
00:17:42,429 --> 00:17:43,995
Hey, Ernest!

193
00:17:44,170 --> 00:17:46,563
Hey, Kelsie Morrison!

194
00:17:46,737 --> 00:17:48,870
- We were at the front - together in France.
- Hey!

195
00:17:49,044 --> 00:17:52,003
- How you doing? - Great to see you!
- You too. You too.

196
00:17:52,178 --> 00:17:53,440
My wife, Catherine Cole.

197
00:17:53,614 --> 00:17:55,746
Oh, pleased to meet you.
Pleased to meet you.

198
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:57,008
Full blood.

199
00:17:58,271 --> 00:18:00,229
Sky People, right? Sky People?

200
00:18:00,403 --> 00:18:03,145
Middle Water. Middle Water.

201
00:18:03,319 --> 00:18:05,278
Lot of money on this.

202
00:18:28,779 --> 00:18:30,216
Whoo!

203
00:18:31,782 --> 00:18:33,610
You got money on this race?

204
00:18:33,784 --> 00:18:34,829
No. No.

205
00:18:35,003 --> 00:18:36,265
Let's go, then.

206
00:18:37,614 --> 00:18:38,702
Yep.

207
00:18:58,722 --> 00:19:01,072
<i>I'm sorry to hear
she's not doing good.</i>

208
00:19:01,247 --> 00:19:03,162
You know, Father,
just as stubborn as ever.

209
00:19:03,336 --> 00:19:05,599
Tell your mom I'm praying
for her, okay?

210
00:19:05,773 --> 00:19:07,470
- Take care. Yeah.
- Thank you, Father.

211
00:19:15,739 --> 00:19:18,438
<i>You know who I mean
when I say Mollie Kyle?</i>

212
00:19:18,612 --> 00:19:20,048
<i>You know the one,
with the sisters.</i>

213
00:19:21,136 --> 00:19:23,530
- I know which one.
- Mollie. - Yeah. Mollie.

214
00:19:23,704 --> 00:19:25,184
She lives with her mother, Lizzie.

215
00:19:26,359 --> 00:19:28,839
I know, Uncle, which one.
I know her.

216
00:19:29,013 --> 00:19:30,928
I've bee...
I've been driving her.

217
00:19:31,886 --> 00:19:32,974
- Driving her?
- Yeah.

218
00:19:34,802 --> 00:19:36,673
Matt Williams used
to go with her for a time.

219
00:19:36,847 --> 00:19:38,632
They're not together
in a way now,

220
00:19:39,198 --> 00:19:40,895
so that means

221
00:19:41,069 --> 00:19:44,420
you could have a proposition
with that if that struck you.

222
00:19:47,423 --> 00:19:52,036
You want... You want me
to see after her.

223
00:19:52,211 --> 00:19:55,083
- She's a regular customer of mine.
- Yeah.

224
00:19:55,257 --> 00:19:57,085
I think she...
She's sweet on me too.

225
00:19:59,130 --> 00:20:02,046
- That Mollie, - she's easy to like. Yeah.
- Yeah.

226
00:20:02,221 --> 00:20:03,918
Full blood estate, at that, too.

227
00:20:05,485 --> 00:20:08,052
- Full... Full blood estate.
- Full... Full blood estate.

228
00:20:08,227 --> 00:20:11,230
Now, that's something
a man can work with, hmm?

229
00:20:17,975 --> 00:20:19,673
You got a good face,
you know that?

230
00:20:22,371 --> 00:20:24,112
Think you can be
the marrying kind?

231
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,028
- Marrying kind?
- Mm-hmm.

232
00:20:27,637 --> 00:20:28,943
Uh, how do you mean?

233
00:20:29,117 --> 00:20:31,380
Well, we mix
these families together,

234
00:20:31,554 --> 00:20:34,862
and that estate money flows
the right direction, it'll come to us.

235
00:20:37,821 --> 00:20:42,652
That's a full blood estate. And she
gets that money of the mother Lizzie.

236
00:20:42,826 --> 00:20:46,743
Now, that's good business there.
And legal, not against the law.

237
00:20:46,917 --> 00:20:49,006
That's smart investment.

238
00:21:01,236 --> 00:21:05,066
They told me you was... you was
going with Matt Williams for a time.

239
00:21:08,243 --> 00:21:09,766
You talk too much.

240
00:21:10,811 --> 00:21:13,944
Nah. Nah, I don't talk too much.

241
00:21:14,118 --> 00:21:17,948
Just thinking who I gotta beat
in this horse race, that's all.

242
00:21:19,863 --> 00:21:21,822
I didn't realize
this was a race.

243
00:21:24,259 --> 00:21:26,479
I don't care
for watching horses.

244
00:21:26,653 --> 00:21:29,699
Well, I'm a different
kind of horse.

245
00:21:34,965 --> 00:21:37,838
What?

246
00:21:38,012 --> 00:21:39,535
What was that?

247
00:21:41,668 --> 00:21:43,800
That's how you are.

248
00:21:43,974 --> 00:21:47,369
I don't know what you said, but it
must've been Indian for "handsome devil."

249
00:22:00,643 --> 00:22:01,644
All right.

Ooh, that rock still shines in
the dark, boys. Give me that.

267
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:37,305
Just take the car. Don't take
my ring. My father gave it to me.

268

Don't want the car.
Just want the jewels.

- Catholic.
- Mmm.

331
00:28:49,051 --> 00:28:51,140
You don't come to church.

332
00:28:51,314 --> 00:28:54,622
- Oh, yes, um, I've been away.
- Hmm.

333
00:29:01,324 --> 00:29:03,196
How come you don't have
a husband?

334
00:29:06,373 --> 00:29:10,290
I'm a man, and I want to know why a
woman like you doesn't have a husband.

335

You know, you got...
You got nice color skin.

You got nice color skin. You-You
got... You got a nice house.

340
00:29:44,237 --> 00:29:46,587

to be so severe.

soft belly on the inside there.

00:29:53,072 --> 00:29:55,901
Oh, you just called me
a coyote, didn't you?

343
00:29:58,599 --> 00:29:59,774
Coyote.

344
00:30:00,775 --> 00:30:04,692
Coyote wants money.

345
00:30:04,866 --> 00:30:06,955
- Well, that money's - real nice.
- Mmm.

346
00:30:07,129 --> 00:30:10,480
It's real nice, especially
if you're lazy like me.

347
00:30:12,047 --> 00:30:15,442
I mean, I wanna sleep all day, and I
wanna make a party when it's dark.

348
00:30:20,055 --> 00:30:22,884
What's so funny, hmm?

349
00:30:23,058 --> 00:30:24,364
You like <i>peh-tseh nee?</i>

350
00:30:25,408 --> 00:30:26,932
- Whiskey.
- Mmm.

351
00:30:28,324 --> 00:30:30,544
I don't like whiskey,
I love whiskey.

352
00:30:32,372 --> 00:30:35,810
I have good whiskey,
not bad whiskey.

353
00:30:37,551 --> 00:30:39,814
I think we should try some
and find out.

354
00:30:54,742 --> 00:30:56,962
No, no. No. No, don't close it.

355
00:30:58,833 --> 00:31:00,661
- What?
- Uh, we...

356
00:31:01,705 --> 00:31:03,316
We need to be quiet for a while.

357
00:31:23,466 --> 00:31:25,077
The storm, it's, uh...

358
00:31:28,558 --> 00:31:30,952
Well, it's powerful.

359
00:31:31,953 --> 00:31:33,781
So we need to be quiet
for a while.

360
00:31:41,354 --> 00:31:44,879
- It's good for the crops, - that's for sure.
- Just be still.

361
00:32:15,910 --> 00:32:17,520
Bill Smith.

362
00:32:19,044 --> 00:32:20,480
Bill Smith.

363
00:32:20,654 --> 00:32:23,004
- Ernest. Ernest Burkhart.
- Good to meet you, Ernest.

364
00:32:23,178 --> 00:32:24,963
I'm Minnie's husband.

365
00:33:08,832 --> 00:33:11,444
It might make you feel a little
better if you eat something.

366
00:33:19,669 --> 00:33:20,844
No, not again. Aw!

367
00:33:21,019 --> 00:33:23,021
He's not that smart...

368
00:33:23,897 --> 00:33:25,941
...but he's handsome.

369
00:33:27,067 --> 00:33:28,944
He looks like a snake.

370
00:33:29,653 --> 00:33:32,948
No, he looks like Coyote.

371
00:33:33,699 --> 00:33:35,576
Those Blue Eyes.

372
00:33:37,327 --> 00:33:41,331
His brother is handsome, too.
I like the brother more.

373
00:33:42,958 --> 00:33:45,043
That red haired rat?

374
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:52,009
Better than your possum
playing dead...

375
00:33:52,426 --> 00:33:54,595
...and lazing around the house.

376
00:33:56,930 --> 00:33:58,348
He's a possum around you...

377
00:33:58,557 --> 00:34:00,768
...he's like a rabbit to me.

378
00:34:02,311 --> 00:34:04,104
Be quiet...!

379
00:34:04,521 --> 00:34:06,440
...Coyote's watching.

380
00:34:08,358 --> 00:34:10,527
He wants our money.

381
00:34:12,029 --> 00:34:13,322
Of course he wants money...

382
00:34:13,739 --> 00:34:16,366
...but he wants to be settled.

383
00:34:18,786 --> 00:34:20,913
He's not restless.

384
00:34:21,580 --> 00:34:23,874
His Uncle has money...

385
00:34:23,999 --> 00:34:26,376
...it's not money he wants...

386
00:34:26,710 --> 00:34:28,086
...he loves you.

387
00:34:46,843 --> 00:34:48,106
Slow down.

388
00:34:53,937 --> 00:34:57,158
Your hand looks on my skin...

389
00:35:11,216 --> 00:35:13,348
You're gonna marry me, Mollie.

390
00:35:16,046 --> 00:35:17,439
I want you to be my wife.

391
00:35:20,399 --> 00:35:21,400
Will you do that?

392
00:35:33,368 --> 00:35:35,327
Can you stand her kind?

393
00:35:39,418 --> 00:35:42,116
I love this girl. Mollie.

394
00:35:42,290 --> 00:35:45,250
Uncle, I...
I really do think she's a lady.

395
00:35:47,904 --> 00:35:50,037
Well, then you found a wife.

396
00:36:01,701 --> 00:36:03,006
<i>Mollie.</i>

397
00:36:04,312 --> 00:36:05,444
Ernest.

398
00:36:40,566 --> 00:36:42,481
I've known
Mollie and her sisters

399
00:36:42,655 --> 00:36:45,658
since they were little girls running
around, making a lot of trouble.

400
00:36:48,791 --> 00:36:51,881
Mollie's dear departed
father, Nah-kah-e-se-y,

401
00:36:52,055 --> 00:36:55,363
was a dear, dear friend of mine,
a beloved friend of the heart.

402
00:36:55,537 --> 00:36:57,887
<i>He always used to tell the
white men just to call him Jimmy,</i>

403
00:36:58,061 --> 00:37:01,978
<i>but I always called him by his
proper name, Nah-kah-e-se-y.</i>

404
00:37:02,152 --> 00:37:04,154
<i>We had great respect
for each other.</i>

405
00:37:51,941 --> 00:37:54,509
You and me.

406
00:37:54,683 --> 00:37:56,076
Whoo!

407
00:37:59,079 --> 00:38:01,124
Keep going right.
I'm going right.

408
00:38:21,101 --> 00:38:22,189
Minnie.

409
00:38:27,847 --> 00:38:30,110
What do you need for, Minnie?

410
00:38:30,284 --> 00:38:31,285
No, sir.

411
00:38:32,155 --> 00:38:33,853
You well taken care of?

412
00:38:36,334 --> 00:38:37,726
Yes.

413
00:38:41,251 --> 00:38:42,688
You have proper medicines?

414
00:38:44,167 --> 00:38:48,084
'Cause I want you to know you
have the best care if you need.

415
00:38:48,258 --> 00:38:49,912
I don't want you to be afraid.

416
00:38:54,830 --> 00:38:58,399
So many troubles that we've
brought upon you, all of you.

417
00:38:58,965 --> 00:39:00,270
I'm so sorry.

418
00:39:01,184 --> 00:39:03,796
I'm so sorry.

419
00:39:43,226 --> 00:39:46,404
<i>Minnie. My sister.</i>

420
00:39:48,710 --> 00:39:50,059
<i>Wasting illness.</i>

421
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:14,344
Anna.

422
00:40:28,533 --> 00:40:29,577
Ernest.

423
00:40:29,751 --> 00:40:31,231
Yeah?

424
00:40:31,405 --> 00:40:34,321
Ernest, it might be best
for you to sit outside.

425
00:40:34,974 --> 00:40:37,846
What... Well, why's that?

426
00:40:39,152 --> 00:40:40,849
It's just the way this is going.

427
00:40:42,285 --> 00:40:43,548
If you don't mind.

428
00:40:48,335 --> 00:40:52,165
"The way this is going"? You...
You're saying you want me outside?

429
00:40:52,339 --> 00:40:53,732
Yes, sir, if you would.

430
00:40:57,562 --> 00:40:58,563
All right.

431
00:41:04,438 --> 00:41:05,831
- Bill Smith.
- Mmm.

432
00:41:08,050 --> 00:41:09,095
Yeah.

433
00:41:10,792 --> 00:41:12,838
It shows itself to you

434
00:41:13,012 --> 00:41:16,276
that Bill Smith didn't take the proper
care of Minnie the way he could have.

435
00:41:16,450 --> 00:41:19,975
To have her sick and die, take
her headrights and her land?

436
00:41:22,064 --> 00:41:24,458
That oil, which should go
to her sisters, your wife,

437
00:41:24,632 --> 00:41:27,374
well, he's taking money that,
by rights, should go to Mollie.

438
00:41:30,856 --> 00:41:32,161
The mother, Lizzie.

439
00:41:38,341 --> 00:41:40,169
She's not in good shape.

440
00:41:40,648 --> 00:41:41,954
She won't last.

441
00:41:43,738 --> 00:41:46,001
Most Osage don't live past 50.

442
00:41:47,220 --> 00:41:48,482
With these women dying,

443
00:41:48,656 --> 00:41:50,571
with how Osage suffer
from illness,

444
00:41:50,745 --> 00:41:53,182
you have to make it
the headrights come to you.

445
00:41:54,836 --> 00:41:56,098
You see?

446
00:41:58,448 --> 00:41:59,449
Yeah.

447
00:41:59,624 --> 00:42:01,147
<i>Minnie's gone now,</i>

448
00:42:01,321 --> 00:42:03,541
<i>and after her, that leaves...</i>

449
00:42:03,715 --> 00:42:05,760
Reta... Mmm.

450
00:42:05,934 --> 00:42:07,240
...Anna,

451
00:42:08,110 --> 00:42:10,373
and then, of course,
there's Mollie.

452
00:42:12,506 --> 00:42:13,681
Yeah.

453
00:42:15,378 --> 00:42:17,163
How's Mollie feeling?

454
00:42:17,337 --> 00:42:19,121
She's... She's all right.

455
00:42:20,688 --> 00:42:22,342
Takes care of the little one.

456
00:42:24,474 --> 00:42:28,478
- She's got the, uh... the diabetes too.
- Yeah.

457
00:42:28,653 --> 00:42:34,049
I worry for her sometimes.
She's... She's sick most days, King.

458
00:42:34,223 --> 00:42:38,184
Of course she is. How could she
not be? This diabetes is a trial to bear.

459
00:42:40,403 --> 00:42:42,318
<i>Like it says in the book of Job,</i>

460
00:42:42,492 --> 00:42:45,452
<i>the days of affliction
have taken hold upon her.</i>

461
00:42:48,498 --> 00:42:52,851
Well, Mollie, she's still
strong, King. She's strong.

462
00:42:53,025 --> 00:42:56,594
Yeah, for now.
We hope, forever, but...

463
00:42:59,988 --> 00:43:03,862
What about Anna? You know
Anna carries a gun in her purse?

464
00:43:04,036 --> 00:43:06,255
Hey, what the hell?

465
00:43:06,429 --> 00:43:08,954
I know you get around...

466
00:43:09,128 --> 00:43:11,739
Shit!

467
00:43:11,913 --> 00:43:14,786
What the hell?
Fucking crazy squaw!

468
00:43:15,830 --> 00:43:17,745
Now, I love Anna,

469
00:43:17,919 --> 00:43:20,966
but she's gonna pick a fight
one day with the wrong person.

470
00:43:21,706 --> 00:43:22,706
And then what?

471
00:44:54,755 --> 00:44:57,236
Hey. Stop
it. Put it all on the table.

472
00:45:00,761 --> 00:45:06,027
- Stop it. Manners.
- Nobody's got any manners here.

473
00:45:06,808 --> 00:45:08,601
Did you see the Owl?

474
00:45:15,817 --> 00:45:17,902
When you do...

475
00:45:18,820 --> 00:45:22,740
...it's a sign that we are dying.

476
00:45:24,159 --> 00:45:25,618
Because... of you.

477
00:45:28,246 --> 00:45:30,915
You all marry white men.

478
00:45:32,959 --> 00:45:35,837
Our blood is getting white.

479
00:45:39,674 --> 00:45:41,801
Where's Anna?

480
00:45:42,886 --> 00:45:45,013
I want Anna.

481
00:45:45,305 --> 00:45:46,806
I'm here.

482
00:45:47,390 --> 00:45:49,267
I don't want you.

483
00:45:49,851 --> 00:45:51,394
I want Anna.

484
00:45:59,037 --> 00:46:01,082
Let's get all of them.

485
00:46:01,256 --> 00:46:04,129
This one's whiter than that one.

486
00:46:04,303 --> 00:46:06,914
You'd never know this one's
a half-breed, would you?

487
00:46:07,088 --> 00:46:11,832
They're both a couple of little half-assed
savages, as far as I'm concerned.

488
00:46:12,006 --> 00:46:15,488
Bless their little hearts, now,
they can't help it.

489
00:46:16,619 --> 00:46:21,624
One dark and one light.
And it's like an eclipse.

490
00:46:21,799 --> 00:46:27,500
The Lord put his hand over the
earth and made it shake for nothing.

491
00:46:28,893 --> 00:46:30,677
Oh, goodness.

492
00:46:30,851 --> 00:46:32,461
- Take care, Anna.
- Oh, thank you, sir.

493
00:46:33,728 --> 00:46:34,854
Are you laughing?

494
00:46:35,063 --> 00:46:36,564
Not yet... but...

495
00:46:44,739 --> 00:46:46,574
I brought blankets for Momma.

496
00:46:47,033 --> 00:46:48,826
You're drunk already?

497
00:46:49,035 --> 00:46:52,162
I'm still drunk from last
night, you woke me up.

498
00:46:52,163 --> 00:46:54,581
Don't let Momma see you this way.

499
00:46:54,582 --> 00:46:56,251
Don't fuss on me.

500
00:46:59,837 --> 00:47:02,535
Hello, Anna. You steady?

501
00:47:02,709 --> 00:47:05,494
Oh, I am pickled.

502
00:47:05,668 --> 00:47:06,669
You got any whiskey?

503
00:47:06,844 --> 00:47:08,541
Well, you drank it last night.

504
00:47:08,715 --> 00:47:10,848
Only my man can drink
my whiskey.

505
00:47:11,022 --> 00:47:12,501
I'm not your man.

506
00:47:12,675 --> 00:47:14,852
Well, maybe you don't have
a choice.

507
00:47:16,104 --> 00:47:18,106
Are you making threats?

508
00:47:18,159 --> 00:47:19,359
Hey, hey.

509
00:47:19,508 --> 00:47:21,684
Keep yourself settled down
in here, Anna.

510
00:47:22,990 --> 00:47:24,122
You'll do right.

511
00:47:25,123 --> 00:47:27,386
You're making threats, Anna.
Don't do that.

512
00:47:28,213 --> 00:47:29,823
I'm telling you a secret.

513
00:47:29,997 --> 00:47:31,956
You think I open my legs
for any man?

514
00:47:32,130 --> 00:47:34,306
Well, I get that feeling.

515
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:35,960
- Hey! Hey!
- Come on, now.

516
00:47:35,960 --> 00:47:37,657
Get her in the other room now.

517
00:47:37,831 --> 00:47:39,441
You are no different,
Ernest. Hear me?

518
00:47:39,441 --> 00:47:41,269
- You are no different.
- Get in the other room!

519
00:47:42,380 --> 00:47:44,215
Older sister, calm down.

520
00:47:44,185 --> 00:47:45,578
Yeah, I'm all right.

521
00:47:59,809 --> 00:48:01,333
You are so pretty.

522
00:48:04,510 --> 00:48:05,859
You know me?

523
00:48:06,860 --> 00:48:07,905
Yes.

524
00:48:08,644 --> 00:48:09,732
What do you know?

525
00:48:11,125 --> 00:48:13,388
Fuck yourself, Byron Burkhart.

526
00:48:13,562 --> 00:48:15,642
- Anna! Anna!
- Hey! Come on, now! Anna!

527
00:48:15,782 --> 00:48:18,742
I will cut you, talking to my man!
I'll kill that woman, then I'll kill you!

528
00:48:18,916 --> 00:48:21,356
- Stand down.
- I'm not your man. I'll do as I please.

529
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:23,355
Get her out of here!

530
00:48:23,529 --> 00:48:25,089
Give me that. She's got a gun!

531
00:48:25,183 --> 00:48:26,227
Give me that. Come on!

532
00:48:26,401 --> 00:48:27,681
Stay away
from these white women!

533
00:48:27,750 --> 00:48:29,056
Stay away from those
<i>wahk' oh nohn-hohn!</i>

534
00:48:29,056 --> 00:48:30,057
Move!

535
00:48:31,015 --> 00:48:32,146
Get out!

536
00:48:36,107 --> 00:48:37,107
Savage!

537
00:48:46,334 --> 00:48:48,423
Come on, Charlie. Right up here.

538
00:49:00,261 --> 00:49:03,134
This one French soldier, he came
up, he tried to grab that saucer pan.

539
00:49:03,308 --> 00:49:06,267
I saw his leg blown clean off.

540
00:49:06,441 --> 00:49:10,228
A lot of them came back
like this. Shaking.

541
00:49:12,273 --> 00:49:13,273
Hey.

542
00:49:14,972 --> 00:49:18,192
Did you hear they found
Charlie Whitehorn dead?

543
00:49:18,366 --> 00:49:21,630
Aye. Aye. Who did that?

544
00:49:22,762 --> 00:49:23,981
I don't know.

545
00:49:25,852 --> 00:49:27,201
Was it his wife?

546
00:49:27,375 --> 00:49:29,203
Mm-hmm. Most likely.

547
00:49:36,602 --> 00:49:37,733
Now, Anna...

548
00:49:43,565 --> 00:49:45,654
It's time for me
to take her home now.

549
00:49:58,307 --> 00:50:00,017
You're...

550
00:50:00,935 --> 00:50:02,979
...wild.

551
00:50:08,025 --> 00:50:10,984
Anna. Anna, <i>mahn-theen eh-txahn.</i>

552
00:50:11,158 --> 00:50:12,681
Byron's waiting. Come on.

553
00:50:13,421 --> 00:50:14,901
Come on, now.

554
00:50:19,328 --> 00:50:23,833
You're my best blessing.

555
00:50:25,793 --> 00:50:28,004
I'm your favorite?

556
00:50:32,091 --> 00:50:37,221
...stay with me here.

557
00:50:38,446 --> 00:50:40,666
Anna, come on, now.
Stop banging.

558
00:50:53,766 --> 00:50:56,682
Time for me to go, Ernest?

559
00:50:58,684 --> 00:50:59,728
Yeah.

560
00:51:00,860 --> 00:51:03,645
You don't want me here, do you?

561
00:51:03,819 --> 00:51:07,040
You trying to get rid of me,
aren't you, snake? Aw.

562
00:51:08,085 --> 00:51:11,218
You're afraid I'll say too much.

563
00:51:13,525 --> 00:51:15,744
Yeah, I see you're afraid.

564
00:51:21,794 --> 00:51:22,969
You look better.

565
00:51:23,143 --> 00:51:24,927
Why, thank you, Sister.

566
00:51:28,148 --> 00:51:30,672
You're my wealth, you know that?

567
00:51:33,653 --> 00:51:35,279
Don't go out tonight.

568
00:51:35,460 --> 00:51:37,331
You worry
too much, <i>oh-theh-zhoo.</i>

569
00:51:37,505 --> 00:51:39,377
Come on. Let's go.

570
00:51:39,551 --> 00:51:40,769
Okay.

571
00:51:40,943 --> 00:51:44,077
Goodness, let's go find
another drink.

572
00:51:44,251 --> 00:51:45,861
No, I'm taking you home, Anna.

573
00:51:46,035 --> 00:51:48,125
No, you're taking me
to Whizbang.

574
00:51:50,562 --> 00:51:52,477
Byron's taking her home now.

575
00:51:53,042 --> 00:51:54,043
I'm too drunk.

576
00:51:54,218 --> 00:51:55,219
You don't say.

577
00:51:55,393 --> 00:51:56,959
He's taking her home.

578
00:52:14,194 --> 00:52:17,371
Mollie, it's your sister, Anna.

579
00:52:59,326 --> 00:53:01,720
Come on, now.
Come on, now, sweetheart.

580
00:53:01,894 --> 00:53:03,025
Come on, now.

581
00:53:04,418 --> 00:53:07,813
Come on.

582
00:53:14,298 --> 00:53:17,083
Is this your sister, Anna Brown?

583
00:53:19,216 --> 00:53:23,872
Pardon me.
Is this your sister, Anna Brown?

584
00:53:25,439 --> 00:53:26,439
Yes...

585
00:53:37,277 --> 00:53:39,192
<i>Two members of our tribe,</i>

586
00:53:39,366 --> 00:53:42,587
<i>Anna Brown
and Charles Whitehorn...</i>

587
00:53:42,761 --> 00:53:44,980
<i>...were both murdered.</i>

588
00:53:45,154 --> 00:53:47,505
These <i>ahn-shdah-heh</i>
are murdering us.

589
00:53:49,376 --> 00:53:50,986
In the case of Anna Brown,

590
00:53:50,986 --> 00:53:53,337
her family here on the west side
have raised funds

591
00:53:53,511 --> 00:53:56,514
of the amount of about
$2,000 to $5,000

592
00:53:56,688 --> 00:54:00,039
for the arrest and conviction
of the murderer.

593
00:54:02,476 --> 00:54:05,087
Mollie Burkhart has hired
a private investigator.

594
00:54:08,874 --> 00:54:10,876
When this money started coming,

595
00:54:11,050 --> 00:54:13,052
we should've known
it came with something else.

596
00:54:13,226 --> 00:54:15,663
'Cause it's
the white man's money.

597
00:54:15,837 --> 00:54:21,190
It's not what we were taught, coming
out of Missouri, Arkansas and Kansas.

598
00:54:21,365 --> 00:54:25,194
What has come to our reservation
that doesn't belong here?

599
00:54:25,369 --> 00:54:29,982
And it's them. They're like
buzzards circling our people.

600
00:54:30,156 --> 00:54:31,636
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

601
00:54:31,810 --> 00:54:34,987
They wanna pick us body clean,
leave nothing.

602
00:54:36,031 --> 00:54:37,381
When we left Missouri,

603
00:54:37,555 --> 00:54:39,992
we didn't even leave
our dead babies.

604
00:54:40,166 --> 00:54:43,256
We laid 'em down and we rode
our warriors over 'em

605
00:54:43,430 --> 00:54:48,174
to tell everyone that we'll
never leave this place again.

606
00:54:48,348 --> 00:54:50,829
Or we'll die here,
to the last one.

607
00:54:51,003 --> 00:54:52,723
Yeah. Yeah.

608
00:55:08,760 --> 00:55:09,761
Switch.

609
00:55:20,728 --> 00:55:24,645
Hey, Mollie. Mollie,
words can't express my grief,

610
00:55:24,819 --> 00:55:27,126
but she's with the Lord now.

611
00:55:27,300 --> 00:55:28,780
She's with the Lord.

612
00:55:34,263 --> 00:55:37,266
And they even come here now
to marry our young women.

613
00:55:39,007 --> 00:55:40,792
I employ some of them.

614
00:55:40,966 --> 00:55:44,230
They say they are my friends,
but I don't think they really are.

615
00:55:44,404 --> 00:55:46,493
<i>Some of them
don't even pretend to work.</i>

616
00:55:46,493 --> 00:55:48,495
<i>They walk around, they
act like they own the place.</i>

617
00:55:48,669 --> 00:55:50,845
- Okay, gentlemen. Hold still, please.
- We got it!

618
00:55:51,019 --> 00:55:55,110
I mean, these people are bums,
<i>nee-shdah-heh,</i> common vags.

619
00:55:56,155 --> 00:55:59,724
We can't turn to the county
to help us.

620
00:56:00,942 --> 00:56:04,555
We can't go to the state
of Oklahoma to help us.

621
00:56:05,643 --> 00:56:07,906
Why have we ever even thought
they would?

622
00:56:08,907 --> 00:56:10,865
We were here before them.

623
00:56:11,039 --> 00:56:12,737
This is our homeland we came to.

624
00:56:12,911 --> 00:56:14,782
Yeah. Yeah.

625
00:56:14,956 --> 00:56:18,177
Why we put our children here is
because Mother Earth allowed us here.

626
00:56:18,351 --> 00:56:19,918
Yeah.

627
00:56:20,092 --> 00:56:23,835
No one takes us off this earth
until God calls us all home.

628
00:56:24,009 --> 00:56:25,010
Yeah.

629
00:56:25,184 --> 00:56:26,838
And we've got to realize that,

630
00:56:27,012 --> 00:56:29,252
but we've also got to realize
this evil that's come here.

631
00:56:29,362 --> 00:56:31,190
You have something it wants.

632
00:56:31,364 --> 00:56:34,498
- Yeah.
- It didn't want you when we was coming through genocides,

633
00:56:34,672 --> 00:56:36,587
our coming home.

634
00:56:36,761 --> 00:56:40,721
But now we put the original
25 families together in this room.

635
00:56:40,895 --> 00:56:41,895
Yeah.

636
00:56:41,983 --> 00:56:43,855
And we're here to go with you.

637
00:56:44,029 --> 00:56:48,555
The old saying says is that...
That Osage is dying by the enemy.

638
00:56:48,729 --> 00:56:52,907
Do not let them die alone.
You go join them.

639
00:56:53,081 --> 00:56:56,824
So we can go to heaven
knowing we're still warriors.

640
00:56:56,998 --> 00:57:02,526
We have to change, but before we
do, we need to be like a fire on this earth

641
00:57:02,700 --> 00:57:06,268
and get rid of all that stops
or gets in front of us.

642
00:57:06,443 --> 00:57:09,620
My council, I ask you
for your support.

643
00:57:09,794 --> 00:57:14,842
All of you men. And our women,
these mothers, these <i>ee-nahn</i> here.

644
00:57:15,016 --> 00:57:18,150
All of our elders have
come through this landscape,

645
00:57:18,324 --> 00:57:22,110
and we... only thing we know
is that we have each other.

646
00:57:23,024 --> 00:57:26,201
We have a Lord
that's been good to us.

647
00:57:26,375 --> 00:57:29,857
And this... this other... We
never prayed for the great life.

648
00:57:30,031 --> 00:57:32,164
We just prayed for life.

649
00:57:32,338 --> 00:57:34,601
And that's what
I'm gonna be praying for now,

650
00:57:34,775 --> 00:57:37,735
is that we get that life
for these kids coming.

651
00:57:37,909 --> 00:57:39,867
And, see, our days are over.

652
00:57:40,912 --> 00:57:43,480
We're just barely
living out a sundown,

653
00:57:43,654 --> 00:57:46,091
but their days are starting.

654
00:57:46,265 --> 00:57:50,051
And I want 'em to be Osages, just
like the gift that Grandma gave me,

655
00:57:50,225 --> 00:57:52,663
just like the gift
that Grandma gave you.

656
00:57:54,621 --> 00:57:56,362
Thank you, Chief.

657
00:57:56,536 --> 00:58:00,018
I would like to add a thousand
dollars to that reward money...

658
00:58:01,846 --> 00:58:05,893
...for any information
about these murders.

659
00:58:06,067 --> 00:58:10,289
That means if anyone knows
anything about it, you must come to me.

660
00:58:11,551 --> 00:58:15,250
You all know where I am.
I'm easy to find.

661
00:58:15,424 --> 00:58:16,984
Thank you, Mr. Hale.

662
00:58:17,035 --> 00:58:19,075
Your friendship has always been
greatly appreciated.

663
00:58:19,124 --> 00:58:23,345
I'll do anything, anything, to
help the Osage in their plight,

664
00:58:23,520 --> 00:58:25,304
in their vale of tears.

665
00:58:25,478 --> 00:58:29,308
I move that we send Mr. Barney
McBride to Washington, D.C.

666
00:58:29,482 --> 00:58:30,483
I will second that.

667
00:58:30,657 --> 00:58:32,877
Mr. McBride, Mrs. McBride.

668
00:58:33,051 --> 00:58:34,792
Yes, Chief. I'm here.

669
00:58:34,966 --> 00:58:38,317
Resolution 23. Mr. McBride
will travel to Washington, D.C.

670
00:58:38,491 --> 00:58:40,362
to meet with
the Indian Affairs Commission,

671
00:58:40,537 --> 00:58:44,366
where he will ask for private
investigators and additional police

672
00:58:44,541 --> 00:58:46,978
so that they can look into
this matter of all this death.

673
00:58:47,152 --> 00:58:48,153
Do you accept this?

674
00:58:48,327 --> 00:58:49,371
Yes, I do.

675
00:58:59,599 --> 00:59:01,601
Bill. Reta.

676
00:59:02,471 --> 00:59:03,647
How are you, Ernest?

677
00:59:04,561 --> 00:59:08,739
So you're, uh...
You're here now, huh?

678
00:59:08,913 --> 00:59:11,306
Reta was a comfort to me
when Minnie died.

679
00:59:31,500 --> 00:59:34,852
Hey, listen.
Leave the jewels be on this one, all right?

680
00:59:35,026 --> 00:59:37,332
Oh, I... I do it
so nobody notices.

681
00:59:37,506 --> 00:59:41,641
No, no. Come on, Frank. Just... just
leave it be, just this one time, for me.

682
00:59:41,815 --> 00:59:45,210
It's my wife's sister,
all right? There.

683
00:59:45,993 --> 00:59:47,952
$25 for a hearse rental?

684
00:59:48,953 --> 00:59:53,871
Uh... $1,650 for-for
a mahogany casket?

685
00:59:55,089 --> 00:59:57,875
You charging me Osage prices.
You think I'm thick, huh?

686
00:59:58,049 --> 00:59:59,877
No, everybody pays the same.

687
01:00:00,051 --> 01:00:03,707
Come on, now. McAllister's
entire funeral wasn't more than 300.

688
01:00:03,881 --> 01:00:05,447
This here...
This here's 2,000, Frank.

689
01:00:05,622 --> 01:00:07,624
McAllister's daughter
was just a youngster.

690
01:00:07,798 --> 01:00:10,627
I'll tell you what. I'ma talk
to King Hale about this.

691
01:00:10,801 --> 01:00:12,454
See what he has to say.

692
01:00:12,629 --> 01:00:14,935
Well, if you want her in a
wooden box, I'll put her in one.

693
01:00:15,109 --> 01:00:18,852
I... I don't want no wooden box, all
right? You are charging me Osage prices.

694
01:00:19,026 --> 01:00:21,942
Your wife even said
she wanted an open casket.

695
01:00:22,682 --> 01:00:24,423
But there's no face.

696
01:00:24,597 --> 01:00:28,645
There's no face, Frank.
Why would she want it open, huh?

697
01:00:28,819 --> 01:00:30,995
You trying to steal our money?
Is that what you're trying...

698
01:00:30,995 --> 01:00:32,039
It ain't...

699
01:00:32,779 --> 01:00:34,520
It ain't your money.

700
01:00:34,694 --> 01:00:38,393
It's easy for you to get me
more money and pay my bill.

701
01:00:38,567 --> 01:00:41,092
I work for my money.

702
01:00:41,266 --> 01:00:45,662
Just like the good Lord says,
you sow and reap, Ernest.

703
01:00:45,836 --> 01:00:49,230
When was the last time you've seen
one of them Osages working, huh?

704
01:00:50,492 --> 01:00:53,147
Well, your sister, Anna,
leaves an estate

705
01:00:53,321 --> 01:00:56,368
of approximately $100,000

706
01:00:56,542 --> 01:01:02,026
to be willed to your mother, Lizzie
Q., and you, Mollie, and you, Reta.

707
01:01:03,592 --> 01:01:07,379
You know, I was thinking, that
is a substantial amount of money.

708
01:01:07,553 --> 01:01:10,643
I heard that Tall Chief hired
the Emmett Miller minstrel show

709
01:01:10,817 --> 01:01:12,906
to come in and play
for his birthday party,

710
01:01:13,080 --> 01:01:18,346
and I thought, "Why... Why couldn't we
do something like that with this money?"

711
01:01:18,520 --> 01:01:21,785
Maybe have a party for the town,
and maybe invite another band out.

712
01:01:21,959 --> 01:01:24,657
<i>It does not do
to talk to this man.</i>

713
01:01:26,659 --> 01:01:28,792
<i>Evil surrounds my heart.</i>

714
01:01:29,531 --> 01:01:31,664
<i>Many times, I cry,</i>

715
01:01:31,838 --> 01:01:35,320
<i>and this evil around my heart
comes out of my eyes.</i>

716
01:01:39,716 --> 01:01:42,544
<i>I close my heart
and keep what is good there,</i>

717
01:01:43,676 --> 01:01:45,199
<i>but hate comes.</i>

718
01:01:47,158 --> 01:01:50,727
<i>And they say I ought to kill these
white men who killed my family.</i>

719
01:01:54,034 --> 01:01:58,038
Mrs. Burkhart. Bill Burns.
I solve crimes.

720
01:01:58,735 --> 01:02:00,345
This is my card.

721
01:02:00,519 --> 01:02:02,826
My address is New York,
London, Paris,

722
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:05,916
Montreal, Chicago, Los Angeles,
Cairo, Berlin, Boston

723
01:02:06,090 --> 01:02:07,874
and wherever else
a law-abiding citizen...

724
01:02:08,048 --> 01:02:10,311
Mr. Barney McBride? Yes.

725
01:02:10,485 --> 01:02:12,565
Telegram for you, sir.
Just arrived.

726
01:02:40,037 --> 01:02:43,344
...hasn't been to Anna's place
to corroborate Byron's story.

727
01:02:43,518 --> 01:02:47,174
Now, I stopped by there, and
I did find her alligator purse,

728
01:02:47,348 --> 01:02:50,351
which could suggest that Byron
is not lying. He brought her home.

729
01:02:51,831 --> 01:02:54,442
Well, my...
My brother's not a liar.

730
01:02:56,270 --> 01:03:01,058
Uh, your youngest sister, Minnie, who
died of the wasting illness two years ago,

731
01:03:01,232 --> 01:03:03,321
she was married
to a "Bill Smith."

732
01:03:03,495 --> 01:03:05,453
Yes.

733
01:03:05,627 --> 01:03:09,718
And that is the same Bill Smith
currently married to your sister, Reta.

734
01:03:10,284 --> 01:03:11,284
Yes.

735
01:03:11,416 --> 01:03:13,722
Same Bill Smith.

736
01:03:15,246 --> 01:03:17,335
Two sisters.

737
01:03:17,509 --> 01:03:23,080
<i>Mr. Smith, he is a busy fellow,
talking around town,</i>

738
01:03:23,254 --> 01:03:25,822
<i>conducting his own investigation
into Anna's death.</i>

739
01:03:25,996 --> 01:03:27,867
- Much obliged, Sheriff.
- Thank you, sir. - Thank y'all again.

740
01:03:27,867 --> 01:03:28,955
Appreciate it.

741
01:03:29,129 --> 01:03:30,652
<i>Were you aware of that?</i>

742
01:03:32,567 --> 01:03:34,047
You were?

743
01:03:34,961 --> 01:03:36,093
Yes.

744
01:03:38,312 --> 01:03:39,923
Now, you went straight
to Mollie's house?

745
01:03:40,097 --> 01:03:41,489
We didn't go straight there.

746
01:03:41,489 --> 01:03:42,839
Where'd you go?

747
01:03:43,013 --> 01:03:45,102
Graveyard out past Florer's.

748
01:03:45,276 --> 01:03:48,540
She wanted to look at her land,
then she wanted to visit her father.

749
01:03:49,671 --> 01:03:51,325
I cannot see my daddy

750
01:03:51,499 --> 01:03:53,762
with my hair flying everywhere.

751
01:03:53,937 --> 01:03:56,156
Did you know I was gonna have
a little baby?

752
01:03:56,330 --> 01:03:59,594
- Oh, my goodness, no.
- Oh, it's true.

753
01:03:59,768 --> 01:04:02,075
I'm gonna name her Minnie too.

754
01:04:08,865 --> 01:04:10,257
Give Minnie my love.

755
01:04:13,304 --> 01:04:15,132
Did you know
that Anna was pregnant?

756
01:04:20,485 --> 01:04:21,573
Anna?

757
01:04:23,053 --> 01:04:24,054
Yes.

758
01:04:29,581 --> 01:04:31,539
Anna was pregnant.

759
01:04:32,366 --> 01:04:33,541
She was pregnant.

760
01:04:34,455 --> 01:04:35,456
Did he say Byron?

761
01:04:37,241 --> 01:04:38,241
No.

762
01:04:40,157 --> 01:04:41,158
Me?

763
01:04:43,247 --> 01:04:45,336
No. No.

764
01:04:46,424 --> 01:04:49,035
Well, you make sure
we steer clear of that.

765
01:04:50,645 --> 01:04:55,128
Mr. Smith says that he has a pretty
good idea who killed your sister.

766
01:04:56,216 --> 01:04:58,740
He says that he will tell all

767
01:04:59,524 --> 01:05:01,004
when he has the true facts.

768
01:05:02,135 --> 01:05:06,183
So what, uh...
What's he found out?

769
01:05:06,357 --> 01:05:08,359
I just don't know that part yet.

770
01:05:09,012 --> 01:05:10,491
What's he found out?

771
01:05:11,579 --> 01:05:12,624
Nothing.

772
01:05:14,278 --> 01:05:15,932
I'll go see Blackie.

773
01:05:20,632 --> 01:05:22,416
On that, what we talked about...

774
01:05:23,113 --> 01:05:24,113
About it, yeah.

775
01:05:24,244 --> 01:05:25,854
To see what he may say on that.

776
01:05:26,333 --> 01:05:27,769
That's right.

777
01:05:33,601 --> 01:05:38,955
Ah, yeah. Yeah! Boy,
we gonna be rich tonight, boy!

778
01:05:41,696 --> 01:05:43,568
- Ernest.
- Where's Blackie?

779
01:05:46,919 --> 01:05:48,921
- That's it, huh?
- Yeah.

780
01:05:50,183 --> 01:05:51,358
Osage graves.

781
01:05:51,532 --> 01:05:52,932
That's disgusting work,
right there.

782
01:05:53,012 --> 01:05:55,145
It's dirty. It's real dirty.

783
01:05:56,276 --> 01:05:58,800
You want something
to pay big, Blackie, hmm?

784
01:05:58,975 --> 01:06:00,889
You can't be working
with them trouble boys.

785
01:06:01,064 --> 01:06:04,110
You gotta use your head.
You gotta think, Blackie.

786
01:06:04,284 --> 01:06:07,331
Hale, he's been... He's been
talking about us partnering up.

787
01:06:10,073 --> 01:06:13,293
You know Bill Smith? He's... He's
been going around town talking a lot.

788
01:06:13,467 --> 01:06:20,213
Now, if someone were to knock off
Bill Smith and... and Reta too, right?

789
01:06:20,387 --> 01:06:25,218
If she was gone, all that estate money
would go to my mother-in-law, Lizzie Q.,

790
01:06:25,392 --> 01:06:27,046
and she wills it to my children.

791
01:06:28,221 --> 01:06:31,659
Now, that's a good deal, that.
It's a real good deal.

792
01:06:31,833 --> 01:06:33,357
- For you, it is.
- Mm-mmm.

793
01:06:33,531 --> 01:06:34,836
For all.

794
01:06:35,011 --> 01:06:37,013
Smith and her,
they're gone a lot from home.

795
01:06:37,187 --> 01:06:39,276
All you gotta do is go down there,
and you plant the stand in the house.

796
01:06:39,276 --> 01:06:41,626
- And when they come in...
- ...you get 'em.

797
01:06:41,800 --> 01:06:45,499
They got... Reta's got three or four
diamonds. She got some ear screws.

798
01:06:45,673 --> 01:06:47,893
Bill Smith, he always carries
two or three hundred in his pocket.

799
01:06:47,893 --> 01:06:50,069
You could have that.

800
01:06:50,243 --> 01:06:54,073
You could have that, and... and I know
Hale would pay you a thousand for the job.

801
01:06:55,770 --> 01:06:57,642
That sound like
a good one to you, Blackie?

802
01:07:02,342 --> 01:07:04,997
You know my little
Buick roadster?

803
01:07:05,171 --> 01:07:07,091
You know, the red one
you always got your eye on.

804
01:07:07,173 --> 01:07:08,870
Yeah?

805
01:07:09,045 --> 01:07:11,351
<i>How about I throw in
my Buick roadster?</i>

806
01:07:11,525 --> 01:07:13,614
<i>It's insured more
than it's worth.</i>

807
01:07:13,788 --> 01:07:16,487
<i>Now, I'd get the insurance
money, and you'd get the Buick.</i>

808
01:07:17,879 --> 01:07:20,708
That... that's just a little side
deal between me and you.

809
01:07:20,882 --> 01:07:22,971
Hale doesn't need to know
about that one.

810
01:07:23,146 --> 01:07:25,148
But that's real generous.

811
01:07:25,322 --> 01:07:27,628
Goddamn, you're a greedy Jew, Ernest.

812
01:07:29,935 --> 01:07:32,068
Well, I just love money.

813
01:07:32,242 --> 01:07:36,246
It's true. It's true. I damn near
love it as much as I love my wife.

814
01:07:40,946 --> 01:07:42,252
Ernest?

815
01:07:42,426 --> 01:07:43,644
Yeah.

816
01:07:44,645 --> 01:07:45,690
Come here.

817
01:07:51,348 --> 01:07:52,436
What is it, huh?

818
01:07:54,873 --> 01:07:56,744
Feeling better
than this morning, huh?

819
01:07:56,918 --> 01:07:58,485
A little.

820
01:07:58,659 --> 01:08:03,795
Yeah. You just... You just
need sleep, I tell you, hmm?

821
01:08:03,969 --> 01:08:06,058
Sleep.
That's the first thing now.

822
01:08:07,233 --> 01:08:09,540
I don't sleep anymore.

823
01:08:09,714 --> 01:08:15,415
I know. I know. Just... Just try.
You try to get some rest, all right?

824
01:08:16,068 --> 01:08:17,113
Come on, now.

825
01:08:21,204 --> 01:08:24,642
I don't even know
if you love me anymore.

826
01:08:24,816 --> 01:08:28,254
Mollie, of course I love you.

827
01:08:29,951 --> 01:08:31,692
I need you here.

828
01:08:32,737 --> 01:08:38,046
I'm right here, Mollie.
I am right here.

829
01:08:41,528 --> 01:08:42,703
I love you.

830
01:09:14,561 --> 01:09:16,911
Oh, you gonna try
to wake the kids up now.

831
01:09:20,611 --> 01:09:22,439
You gonna wake the kids up.

832
01:09:24,092 --> 01:09:26,051
Yeah. Yeah.

833
01:09:30,055 --> 01:09:34,015
<i>They're calling it "insulin.
" It's from Toronto and costs dearly.</i>

834
01:09:35,495 --> 01:09:38,063
<i>There ain't more than five
people that can afford it.</i>

835
01:09:38,237 --> 01:09:42,546
It ain't officially for sale yet, but
Bill Hale has seen to it for you.

836
01:09:43,547 --> 01:09:45,070
Did you hear that, sweetheart?

837
01:09:46,593 --> 01:09:48,160
This one. This one.

838
01:09:48,334 --> 01:09:50,684
It's from a cow's pancreas.

839
01:09:52,686 --> 01:09:55,123
- It'll come down to us - once a week.
- Mmm.

840
01:09:56,255 --> 01:09:57,430
Look at that.

841
01:09:58,301 --> 01:10:02,435
Wow. A cow's pancreas.

842
01:10:03,523 --> 01:10:06,352
- Diabetes can be - an awful misery.
- Mmm.

843
01:10:07,658 --> 01:10:10,008
- Have you eaten - in the last hour?
- No.

844
01:10:10,182 --> 01:10:11,836
Lift your blouse, please.

845
01:10:12,402 --> 01:10:13,620
There you go.

846
01:10:13,794 --> 01:10:15,753
Have you had anything to drink?

847
01:10:15,927 --> 01:10:19,104
Goat's milk. Hotcakes.

848
01:10:22,760 --> 01:10:26,894
Well, she's had, uh... taffy
and bacon too. Go on. Tell 'em.

849
01:10:27,068 --> 01:10:28,896
You gotta tell 'em.

850
01:10:29,070 --> 01:10:32,117
If you don't stop eating sweets,
this won't matter.

851
01:10:32,291 --> 01:10:35,425
You will lose your feet, or
worse, if you eat like a white.

852
01:10:35,990 --> 01:10:37,253
Hear that?

853
01:10:39,864 --> 01:10:41,431
It's all right.

854
01:10:43,433 --> 01:10:44,521
Goddamn it.

855
01:10:46,523 --> 01:10:48,525
Hey, Blackie, stop! Blackie!

856
01:10:48,525 --> 01:10:49,961
Oh, shit. Stop!

857
01:10:49,961 --> 01:10:51,919
Goddamn it, Blackie!
Stop running!

858
01:10:52,093 --> 01:10:53,965
- Where are you - gonna go to?
- You gotta catch me first!

859
01:10:53,965 --> 01:10:56,054
Ooh, look at that.

860
01:11:05,890 --> 01:11:07,065
Hey there.

861
01:11:09,720 --> 01:11:11,504
You brought the Buick out, huh?

862
01:11:12,288 --> 01:11:14,855
Get in. Get in.

863
01:11:36,834 --> 01:11:37,835
Byron.

864
01:11:38,531 --> 01:11:40,316
Brother, come here.

865
01:11:44,189 --> 01:11:45,712
- Here?
- Yeah, right there.

866
01:11:49,412 --> 01:11:50,848
Kneel, please, Ernest.

867
01:11:52,328 --> 01:11:53,329
Kneel.

868
01:12:03,295 --> 01:12:05,384
Did you make a deal
with Blackie Thompson

869
01:12:05,558 --> 01:12:08,996
to steal your red roadster
and cash the insurance?

870
01:12:11,869 --> 01:12:13,044
Um...

871
01:12:15,002 --> 01:12:16,047
I, um...

872
01:12:18,049 --> 01:12:19,529
Yes, I did.

873
01:12:19,703 --> 01:12:23,707
Well, Blackie's been arrested
for stealing your car.

874
01:12:24,490 --> 01:12:26,100
What were you supposed to do?

875
01:12:28,015 --> 01:12:32,846
I was... I was supposed to feel
him out on, uh... on Bill and Reta.

876
01:12:33,020 --> 01:12:35,632
So who takes care of Bill Smith
and his blanket now?

877
01:12:36,981 --> 01:12:38,809
I... Hmm?

878
01:12:39,549 --> 01:12:40,985
I don't know, sir.

879
01:12:43,683 --> 01:12:44,902
Remove the book.

880
01:12:45,555 --> 01:12:46,556
I...

881
01:12:52,083 --> 01:12:53,606
I'm sorry.

882
01:12:53,780 --> 01:12:56,348
All right, Brother. Stand up.

883
01:12:56,957 --> 01:12:58,002
Stand up.

884
01:13:01,962 --> 01:13:03,224
Elbows on the table.

885
01:13:18,152 --> 01:13:22,026
I'm a 32nd degree Mason.

886
01:13:22,200 --> 01:13:24,115
I am imbued

887
01:13:25,769 --> 01:13:30,164
with confidence, trust and
responsibility, among other things.

888
01:13:31,122 --> 01:13:32,166
Yes, sir.

889
01:13:32,819 --> 01:13:33,994
You know what that is?

890
01:13:35,518 --> 01:13:36,997
No, sir.

891
01:13:38,129 --> 01:13:39,391
Shit!

892
01:13:48,052 --> 01:13:49,096
Damn.

893
01:13:52,012 --> 01:13:53,840
Now get up! Sit over there.

894
01:14:06,070 --> 01:14:08,812
Are you challenged
to lead your house?

895
01:14:09,813 --> 01:14:12,685
Mm-mmm. No.

896
01:14:13,860 --> 01:14:16,254
She's hired
a private investigator

897
01:14:17,342 --> 01:14:20,040
who noses and brings
unwanted eyes.
