[00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000] The End
[00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000] Do you find me sadistic?
[00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000] No, kiddo.
[00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000] I'd like to believe
[00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000] you're aware enough, even now,
[00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000] to know that there's nothing sadistic
[00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000] in my actions.
[00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000] At this moment,
[00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000] this is me
[00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000] and my most
[00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000] methodistic.
[00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000] Will?
[00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000] It's your dream.
[00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000] Looked dead, didn't I?
[00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000] Well, I wasn't.
[00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000] But it wasn't from lack of trying, I can tell you that.
[00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000] Actually, Bill's last bullet put me in a coma.
[00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000] A coma I was to lie in for four years.
[00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000] When I woke up,
[00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000] I went on what the movie advertisements
[00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000] refer to as a roaring rampage
[00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000] of revenge.
[00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000] I roared.
[00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000] And I rampaged.
[00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000] And I got bloody satisfaction.
[00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000] I've killed a hell of a lot of people
[00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000] to get to this point.
[00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000] But I have only one more.
[00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000] The last one.
[00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000] The one I'm driving to right now.
[00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000] The only one left.
[00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:42,000] And when I arrive at my destination,
[00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000] I am gonna kill Bill.
[00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000] theais...
[00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:59,000] The.
[00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:14,840] Now, the incident that happened at the Two Pines Wedding Chapel
[00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:17,760] that put this whole gory story into motion
[00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:20,040] has since become legend.
[00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:23,100] Massacre at Two Pines.
[00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,260] That's what the newspapers called it.
[00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:30,940] The local TV news called it the El Paso, Texas Wedding Chapel Massacre.
[00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:34,000] How it happened, who was there,
[00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:36,880] how many got killed and who killed them,
[00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:40,160] changes depending on who's telling the story.
[00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:45,160] In actual fact, the massacre didn't happen during a wedding at all.
[00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:47,940] It was a wedding rehearsal.
[00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:53,400] Now, when we come to the part where I say you may kiss the bride,
[00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:55,500] you may kiss the bride,
[00:02:56,020 --> 00:02:57,860] but don't stick a tongue in her mouth.
[00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:02,740] This might be funny to your friends,
[00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:05,580] but it would be embarrassing to your parents.
[00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:09,180] We'll try to restrain ourselves.
[00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:13,020] Y'all got a song?
[00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:18,580] How about Love Me Tender?
[00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:19,780] I can play that.
[00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:21,300] Sure.
[00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:24,040] Let Me Tender be great.
[00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:26,840] Rufus, he's the man.
[00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:31,240] Rufus, who was that you used to play for?
[00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:32,360] Rufus Thomas.
[00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:34,640] Rufus Thomas.
[00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:36,480] Rufus Thomas.
[00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:37,740] I was a drill.
[00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:39,060] I was a drifter.
[00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:40,440] I was a coaster.
[00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:42,400] I was part of the gang.
[00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,120] I was a bar K.
[00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:45,860] If they come through Texas,
[00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:47,500] I done played with them.
[00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:51,800] Rufus, he's the man.
[00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:56,480] Have I forgotten anything?
[00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,900] Um, oh yes, you forgot the seating arrangements.
[00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,140] Thank you, Mother.
[00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:02,880] Yes.
[00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:06,100] Now, the way we normally do this,
[00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:08,720] we have the bride's side,
[00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:10,500] and then we have the groom's side.
[00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:13,060] But since the bride ain't got nobody coming,
[00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:17,940] and the groom's got far too many people coming...
[00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:19,760] Well, yeah, they're coming all the way from Oklahoma.
[00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:23,000] Right.
[00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,020] Well, I don't see no problem with...
[00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:30,820] the groom's side sharing the bride's side.
[00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:31,360] Do you, Mother?
[00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:32,900] No, I don't have a problem with that.
[00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,280] But, uh...
[00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:38,680] Honey, you know, it would be good if you had somebody come.
[00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:41,340] You know, is it a sign of good faith?
[00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:45,340] Well, I don't have anybody...
[00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:48,820] except for Tommy and my friends.
[00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:51,480] You have no family?
[00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,360] Well, I'm working on changing that.
[00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:57,740] Mrs. Harmony, we're all the family this Elangel's ever gonna need.
[00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,000] I'm not feeling very well, and this bitch is starting to piss me off.
[00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,000] So while you all blather on, I'm gonna go outside and get some air.
[00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000] Okay.
[00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000] Um, uh, Brevin, sorry.
[00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000] Uh, she's gonna go out and get some air?
[00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000] Yeah, given her delicate condition.
[00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000] She just needs a few minutes to get it together. She'll be okay.
[00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:48,000] I don't care.
[00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:57,000] I...
[00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:26,980] Thank you.
[00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:38,200] Hello, kiddo.
[00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:45,080] How did you find me?
[00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:47,640] I'm the man.
[00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:53,200] What are you doing here?
[00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:56,620] What am I doing?
[00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:03,780] Well, a moment ago I was playing my flute.
[00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:17,720] At this moment, I'm looking at the most beautiful bride these old eyes have ever seen.
[00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:21,380] Why are you here?
[00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:23,320] Last look.
[00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:27,740] Are you gonna be nice?
[00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,020] I've never been nice my whole life.
[00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:34,920] But I'll do my best to be sweet.
[00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:42,740] I always told you, your sweet side is your best side.
[00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:47,340] I guess that's why you're the only one who's ever seen it.
[00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:51,960] See, you got a bun in the oven.
[00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:53,720] Hmm.
[00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:57,300] I'm knocked up.
[00:07:58,440 --> 00:07:59,600] Jeez Louise.
[00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:05,140] That young man of yours sure doesn't believe in wasting time, does he?
[00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:07,780] Have you seen Tommy?
[00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:12,180] Big guy in the tux?
[00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:13,380] Yes.
[00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:15,260] Then I saw him.
[00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:18,620] I like his hair.
[00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:22,700] You promised you'd be nice.
[00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:26,800] I said I'd do my best.
[00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,460] That's hardly a promise.
[00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:30,800] But you're right.
[00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:34,860] What does your young man do for a living?
[00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:39,920] He owns a used record store here in El Paso.
[00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:40,720] Ah.
[00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,520] Music lover, eh?
[00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:44,300] He's fond of music.
[00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:46,920] Aren't we all?
[00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:55,220] And what are you doing for a J.O.B. these days?
[00:08:57,220 --> 00:08:58,860] I work in the record store.
[00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:01,860] Ah, so...
[00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:06,240] It all suddenly seems so clear.
[00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,420] Do you like it?
[00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:13,660] Yeah, I like it a lot, smartass.
[00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:16,860] I get to listen to music all day.
[00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,240] Talk about music all day.
[00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:20,020] It's really cool.
[00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:25,500] It's gonna be a great environment for my little girl to grow up in.
[00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:36,020] As opposed to jetting around the world, killing human beings, and being paid vast sums of money.
[00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:39,840] Precisely.
[00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:40,840] Well, my old friend...
[00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:41,840] Well, my old friend...
[00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:44,080] To each his own.
[00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:46,840] However...
[00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:49,840] All cock-blockery aside...
[00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:52,760] I am looking forward to meeting your young man.
[00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:55,760] I happen to be more or less particular...
[00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,760] Who my gal marries.
[00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:58,260] Morning.
[00:09:58,260 --> 00:09:58,760] Brought'sback...
[00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:06,160] gibberish...
[00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:08,280] Marries...
[00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:18,480] I love how we do a么-
[00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000] You want to come to the wedding?
[00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:05,240] Only if I can sit on the bride's side.
[00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,240] You'll find it a bit lonely on my side.
[00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:12,720] Your side always was a bit lonely.
[00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,420] But I wouldn't sit anywhere else.
[00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:23,500] You know, I had the loveliest dream about you.
[00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:25,220] Oh, here's Tommy. Call me Arlene.
[00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,460] You must be Tommy.
[00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:28,040] Uh-huh.
[00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:29,940] Arlene's told me so much about you.
[00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:31,660] Honey, you okay?
[00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:32,880] Oh, I'm fine.
[00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:35,360] Tommy, I'd like you to meet my father.
[00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,420] Oh, my God.
[00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:41,000] Oh, my God, this is great.
[00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:43,000] I'm so glad to meet you, sir.
[00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:44,140] Oh, Dad.
[00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:45,720] The name's Bill.
[00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:47,460] Well, it's great to meet you.
[00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:50,440] Bill, Arlene told me you couldn't make it.
[00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:51,820] Surprise.
[00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:53,320] That's my pop for you.
[00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:54,960] Always full of surprises.
[00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:57,860] Well, in the surprise department,
[00:10:57,860 --> 00:11:01,140] the apple doesn't fall far from the tree.
[00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:03,340] When did you get in?
[00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:04,160] Just now.
[00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:06,320] Did you come straight from Australia?
[00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:07,880] Of course.
[00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:09,960] Daddy, I told Tommy that you were in Perth
[00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,020] lining for silver, and
[00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:12,800] no one could reach you.
[00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:14,980] Lucky for us all,
[00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:16,520] that's not the case.
[00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:20,500] So, what's this all about?
[00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:23,240] I've heard of wedding rehearsals,
[00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:25,420] but I don't believe I've ever heard
[00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:27,460] of a wedding dress rehearsal before.
[00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:28,520] We thought.
[00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:30,600] Why pay so much money for a dress
[00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:31,640] you're only gonna wear once?
[00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:34,740] Especially when Arlene looks so goddamn beautiful in it.
[00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:36,040] So, uh,
[00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:37,660] I think we're gonna try to get all the mileage
[00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:38,400] we can out of it.
[00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:42,180] Isn't it supposed to be bad luck
[00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:43,820] for the groom to see the bride
[00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:44,900] in her wedding dress
[00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:46,420] before the ceremony?
[00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:48,040] Well,
[00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:50,820] I guess I just believe in living dangerously.
[00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:54,360] I know just what you mean.
[00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:55,740] Son,
[00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:58,480] some of us have places to be.
[00:11:58,720 --> 00:11:59,360] It's your old Duke.
[00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:00,660] Look,
[00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:02,540] we gotta go through this one more time.
[00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:03,360] So, uh,
[00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:04,400] why don't you have a s-
[00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:05,580] Oh, my God.
[00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:07,700] What am I thinking?
[00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:08,660] You should give her away!
[00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:09,280] Tommy,
[00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:11,340] that's not exactly Daddy's cup of tea.
[00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:14,740] I think Father would be much more comfortable
[00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:16,640] sitting with the rest of the guests.
[00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:17,060] Oh,
[00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:18,000] really?
[00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:19,920] That's asking a lot.
[00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:22,220] Oh.
[00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:23,460] Okay.
[00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:24,400] Well, forget it.
[00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:26,640] But how about we go out to dinner tonight
[00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:27,140] and celebrate?
[00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:29,280] Only on the condition that I pay for
[00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:29,760] or everything?
[00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:30,660] Deal.
[00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:32,200] We gotta do this now.
[00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:33,700] Can I watch?
[00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:34,980] Absolutely.
[00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:35,720] Have a seat.
[00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:38,280] Which is the bride's side?
[00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:39,500] Right over here.
[00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:44,180] Mother!
[00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:45,020] Here we go!
[00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:46,120] Yeah.
[00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:47,760] Now.
[00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:48,580] Son.
[00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:49,180] í about them bows?
[00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:50,680] No.
[00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:51,520] You ready?
[00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:52,840] Yeah, yeah.
[00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:53,680] Yeah.
[00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:54,680] Oh, shit.
[00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:59,680] Belle, I just want him.
[00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:03,680] You know, I mean, a damn thing.
[00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:08,680] If he's the man you want, then go stand by.
[00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:33,680] Do I look pretty?
[00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:35,680] Oh, yeah.
[00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:48,680] Thank you.
[00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:52,680] Thank you.
[00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:24,140] Well, it gets heavy much more bullets, sir.
[00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:26,060] What the hell?
[00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:27,980] Oh, no!
[00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:29,280] Bill!
[00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:52,280] You
[00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:14,500] You telling me she cut her way through 88 bodyguards before she got to O'Ren?
[00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:16,880] Nah, that wasn't really 88 of them.
[00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:19,600] They just called themselves a crazy 88.
[00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:20,600] How come?
[00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:21,760] I don't know.
[00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:23,920] I guess they thought it sounded cool.
[00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:28,920] Anyhow, they all fell under her Hanzo sword.
[00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:30,760] She got a Hanzo sword?
[00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:32,580] He made one for her.
[00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:35,920] Didn't he swear a blood oath to never make another sword?
[00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:39,940] It would appear he has broken it.
[00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:45,360] Them Japs sure know how to hold the grudge, don't they?
[00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:52,740] Well, maybe you just tend to bring that out in people.
[00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:57,400] I know this is a ridiculous question before I ask it.
[00:15:57,400 --> 00:16:02,620] But you haven't by any chance kept up with your swordplay.
[00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:06,400] I, uh...
[00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:10,560] I pawned that years ago.
[00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:14,600] You hawked a Hattori Hanzo sword.
[00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:16,240] It...
[00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,500] It was priceless.
[00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:19,500] Well...
[00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:26,340] Not in El Paso, it ain't.
[00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:30,960] In El Paso, I got me $250 for it.
[00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:34,680] I'm a bouncer in a titty bar, Bill.
[00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:43,720] If she wants to fight with me, all she's got to do is come down to the club and start some shit and we'll be in a fight.
[00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:49,780] I know we haven't spoken in some time.
[00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:53,320] And the last time we spoke wasn't the most pleasant.
[00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:57,940] But you've got to get over being mad at me.
[00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:01,280] And start becoming afraid of you.
[00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:02,900] Because she is coming.
[00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:04,560] And she's coming to kill you.
[00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:10,360] And unless you accept my assistance, I have no doubt she will succeed.
[00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:21,320] I don't dodge guilt.
[00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:24,240] And I don't chew out of hand my comeuppance.
[00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,240] But...
[00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:28,240] Can't we just...
[00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:29,940] Forget the past?
[00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:34,240] That woman...
[00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:36,720] Deserves her revenge.
[00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:44,300] And...
[00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:46,000] We deserve to die.
[00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:53,240] But then again...
[00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,320] So does she.
[00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:00,820] So I guess...
[00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:03,160] We'll...
[00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:04,160] Just see.
[00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:06,580] Won't we?
[00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:25,040] I guess.
[00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:27,040] Let's go.
[00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:46,500] Late again.
[00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:49,500] Bud, can't you tell time?
[00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:51,440] There ain't nobody in here, man.
[00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:52,560] Is that a book?
[00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:53,940] Yeah.
[00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:57,040] Tell him to get his fucking ass back here.
[00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:59,040] Okay.
[00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:02,740] Bud, Larry'd like the word with you.
[00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:03,740] Mm.
[00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:08,260] Take it here.
[00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:10,260] Be somebody, baby.
[00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:21,460] You looking for me?
[00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:29,040] I don't know what the car wash you worked before you came here.
[00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:35,160] They let you stroll in 20 minutes late, but it wasn't owned by me, and I own a fucking car wash.
[00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:35,980] Do you want me to leave?
[00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:36,980] No, I don't want you to leave.
[00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:37,980] I want you to sit and wait.
[00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:38,980] Larry.
[00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:39,980] There ain't nobody out there.
[00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:40,980] You see?
[00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:41,980] Larry.
[00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:44,080] There ain't nobody out there.
[00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:45,080] You see?
[00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:48,080] There's a little help in there.
[00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:49,080] Larry.
[00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:52,200] What's your plan?
[00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:54,200] That you're not needed here?
[00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:59,300] My point is on the bouncer.
[00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:00,300] You see?
[00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:01,300] I'm not needed here.
[00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:03,300] My point is on the bouncer.
[00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,960] And there ain't nobody out there to balance.
[00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:04,880] You're saying that the reason...
[00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:09,880] that you're not doing the job that I'm...
[00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,440] paying you to do is...
[00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:14,880] that you don't have a job to do?
[00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:19,240] No. Is that what you're saying?
[00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:21,240] What are you trying to convince me of exactly?
[00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:24,160] That you're as useless as an asshole right here?
[00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:27,120] Well, guess what, buddy.
[00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:31,600] I think you just fucking convinced me.
[00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,760] Let's go to the calendar.
[00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:36,400] It's calendar time.
[00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:39,560] Calendar time for buddy.
[00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:41,560] Okay, you working tomorrow?
[00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:42,680] Yeah.
[00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:45,000] No, you're not.
[00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:47,560] You don't even know what fucking day you work.
[00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:50,160] Here, you're not working tomorrow. You're working Wednesday.
[00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:52,520] Here you are. There you go.
[00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:54,080] You working Thursday?
[00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:55,040] Yeah.
[00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:56,440] I don't think so.
[00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:58,120] Friday.
[00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:00,840] I don't... There's your name.
[00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:03,760] There used to be your name.
[00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:04,800] Okay?
[00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:05,840] Saturday.
[00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:07,400] There used to be your name.
[00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:08,320] Oh.
[00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:09,640] Monday, you go...
[00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:11,400] Here, how about that?
[00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:15,000] Fucking with your cash is the only thing you kids seem to understand.
[00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:16,520] Okay?
[00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:19,880] I want you to go home till I call you.
[00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,600] Till I call you.
[00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:25,720] Before you leave, talk to Rocket. She's got a job for you to do.
[00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:26,560] You...
[00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:31,760] to be your wives and my husband and...
[00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:32,680] jas earlier…
[00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:33,720] And...
[00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:37,880] That...
[00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:38,780] That fucking hat.
[00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:41,780] I don't know how many times have I told you
[00:21:41,780 --> 00:21:44,780] don't wear that fucking hat here.
[00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:46,780] How many?
[00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:52,780] Customers wear hats.
[00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:54,780] I'm not the boss of the customers.
[00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:56,780] I'm the boss of you.
[00:21:56,780 --> 00:21:58,780] And I'm telling you
[00:21:58,780 --> 00:22:03,780] that I want you to keep that shit kicker hat at home.
[00:22:08,780 --> 00:22:12,780] Anyway, you could let your kids go
[00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:16,780] and put their hands in and brush it through.
[00:22:16,780 --> 00:22:18,780] And how many people grow up?
[00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:20,780] Your mask helps you so efficiently.
[00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:22,780] bordering and touching a different light.
[00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:24,780] The other person was laying around thedi info
[00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:26,780] andغuracja for the speakers.
[00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:28,780] They do not take this stuff to theücke.
[00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:30,780] Anything else?
[00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:32,780] Is it perfect for the 31st place to get sick?
[00:22:32,780 --> 00:22:33,780] I needcerts.
[00:22:37,780 --> 00:22:38,780] I'm classless.
[00:22:38,780 --> 00:22:42,280] But, honey, the toilet is at it again.
[00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:45,280] There's shitty water all over the floor.
[00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:47,280] OK.
[00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:48,080] Rock it.
[00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:52,080] I'll clean it up.
[00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:52,980] Mm-hmm.
[00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:12,580] 000 ?
[00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:41,980] Here is our crickets.
[00:23:41,980 --> 00:24:11,960] I don't know.
[00:24:11,980 --> 00:24:41,960] I don't know.
[00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:43,980] I don't know.
[00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,800] To get a start in life's game
[00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:07,600] Then suddenly it happened
[00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:11,480] I lost every dime
[00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:15,080] But I'm richer than I'm more
[00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:53,860] How many times have you heard someone say
[00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,980] He sucks
[00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:03,900] Has he scared me from
[00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:06,500] Sure
[00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:07,560] I just um, am a fish
[00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:15,220] That's good
[00:26:15,220 --> 00:26:16,820] What he's a citizen
[00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:18,680] About who he's got
[00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:21,740] Like, Um finalement
[00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:24,080] I've eaten
[00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:26,840] Be a real
[00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:33,840] No. That gentled you down some, didn't it?
[00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:46,840] Yep.
[00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:51,840] Ain't nobody a badass with a double dose of rock salt.
[00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:54,840] Got deep in their tits.
[00:26:56,840 --> 00:27:01,840] Not having tits.
[00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:07,840] It's fine.
[00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:10,840] As big as yours.
[00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:15,840] I can't even imagine how bad that shit must sting.
[00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:20,840] Yeah.
[00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:26,840] I don't want to, neither.
[00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:27,840] I will.
[00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:28,840] I will.
[00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:29,840] I will.
[00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:30,840] I will.
[00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:31,840] I will.
[00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:32,840] I will.
[00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:33,840] I will.
[00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:34,840] I will.
[00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:35,840] I will.
[00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:36,840] I will.
[00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:37,840] I will.
[00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:38,840] I will.
[00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:39,840] I will.
[00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:40,840] I will.
[00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:41,840] I will.
[00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:42,840] I will.
[00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:43,840] I will.
[00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:44,840] I will.
[00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:45,840] I will.
[00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:47,840] I will.
[00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:49,840] I will.
[00:27:49,840 --> 00:28:10,840] I will.
[00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:40,820] I don't know.
[00:28:40,840 --> 00:29:10,820] I don't know.
[00:29:10,820 --> 00:29:12,820] Bingo.
[00:29:12,820 --> 00:29:16,820] And to what do I owe this dubious pleasure?
[00:29:16,820 --> 00:29:19,820] I just caught being the cowgirl.
[00:29:19,820 --> 00:29:22,820] Ain't never been caught.
[00:29:22,820 --> 00:29:24,820] Did you kill her?
[00:29:24,820 --> 00:29:26,820] Well, not yet I ain't.
[00:29:26,820 --> 00:29:28,820] I shot her full of rock salt.
[00:29:28,820 --> 00:29:30,820] She's so gentle right now.
[00:29:30,820 --> 00:29:34,820] I could perform her coup de gras with a rock.
[00:29:34,820 --> 00:29:36,820] Anywho.
[00:29:36,820 --> 00:29:42,820] Guess what I'm holding in my hand right now?
[00:29:42,820 --> 00:29:44,820] What?
[00:29:44,820 --> 00:29:50,820] A brand spanking new Hattori Hanzo sword.
[00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:52,820] And I'm here to tell you how.
[00:29:52,820 --> 00:29:56,820] That's what I call sharp.
[00:29:56,820 --> 00:29:57,820] How much?
[00:29:57,820 --> 00:29:59,820] Well, that's hard to say, being that it's...
[00:29:59,820 --> 00:30:11,820] Juiced...
[00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:15,820] You sign in, it happens.
[00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000] Priceless and all.
[00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000] What's the terms?
[00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:08,000] You get your bony ass down here first thing in the morning.
[00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:12,000] With a million dollars in folding cash,
[00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:18,000] and I give you the greatest sword ever made by a man.
[00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000] How do you like the sound of that?
[00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:28,000] Sounds like we got a deal. One condition.
[00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000] What?
[00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:34,000] She must suffer to her last breath.
[00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000] Well...
[00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000] That ill, darling,
[00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:42,000] I can pretty much damn well guarantee.
[00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:46,000] Then I'll see you in the morning, millionaire.
[00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000] Alright.
[00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000] What?
[00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:14,000] The night isWhy
[00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:19,460] Lives later you hine giants,
[00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:22,760] they just tell you.
[00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:26,680] You devil, no s'mon when I fuck you,
[00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:33,980] stop the hell so that you will got to be thrown.
[00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:38,900] He said he listened to a bedroom.
[00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:51,100] Wakey-wakey.
[00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:53,300] Eggs and bakey.
[00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:29,900] I'm done!
[00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:36,900] Get me out of this hole!
[00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:48,900] I'm done.
[00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:52,900] I'm done.
[00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:56,900] I'm done.
[00:32:56,900 --> 00:33:00,900] I'm done.
[00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:04,900] I'm done.
[00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:10,900] I'm done.
[00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:12,900] Look at those eyes.
[00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:16,900] This bitch is furious.
[00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:20,900] What did I tell you?
[00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:24,900] Is she the cutest little blonde pussy you ever saw?
[00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:28,900] Or is she the cutest little blonde pussy you ever saw?
[00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:38,900] I'm done.
[00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:40,900] I'm done.
[00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:42,900] I'm done.
[00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:44,900] I'm done.
[00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:46,900] I'm done.
[00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:48,900] I'm done.
[00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:50,900] I'm done.
[00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:52,900] You grab the feet.
[00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:56,900] I'll get the head.
[00:33:56,900 --> 00:34:00,900] I'm done.
[00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:02,900] Hey.
[00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:04,900] Hey!
[00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:06,900] We have a worm.
[00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:08,900] You see this?
[00:34:08,900 --> 00:34:12,900] You see it, don't you?
[00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:16,900] That's a can of mace.
[00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:20,900] Well, you're going underneath the ground tonight.
[00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:26,900] And that's all there is to it.
[00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:28,900] I wanna bury you.
[00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:33,900] I was gonna bury you.
[00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:41,900] Like this.
[00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:47,900] But if you're gonna act like a horse's ass,
[00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:54,900] I'm gonna spray this whole goddamn can
[00:34:54,900 --> 00:34:56,900] right in your eyeballs.
[00:34:56,900 --> 00:34:58,900] I'll burn them right out of your fucking head.
[00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:07,000] Then you're gonna be blind, a burner, and buried alive.
[00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:18,000] Now what's it gonna be, sister?
[00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:31,000] That's a wide intercession.
[00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:46,000] This is for breaking my brother's heart.
[00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:20,000] I'll never die.
[00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,680] Oh!
[00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:23,860] Uh.
[00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:26,980] Ugh.
[00:36:27,140 --> 00:36:28,740] Fuck!
[00:36:28,740 --> 00:36:30,300] Ah!
[00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:32,400] Ugh.
[00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:34,540] Ugh!
[00:36:34,540 --> 00:37:04,520] Oh, my God.
[00:37:04,540 --> 00:37:34,520] Oh, my God.
[00:37:34,540 --> 00:38:04,520] Oh, my God.
[00:38:04,540 --> 00:38:34,520] Oh, my God.
[00:38:34,520 --> 00:39:04,500] Oh, my God.
[00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:34,500] Oh, my God.
[00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:36,500] Oh, my God.
[00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:40,500] Once upon a time, in China,
[00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:48,140] some believe around the year 1003,
[00:39:48,140 --> 00:39:52,140] head priest of the White Lotus Clan,
[00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:55,980] Pai May was walking down a road,
[00:39:55,980 --> 00:39:57,980] and contemplating,
[00:39:57,980 --> 00:39:59,980] contemplating whatever it is.
[00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:01,980] Thank you, God.
[00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:05,000] that a man of Paimei's infinite powers would contemplate,
[00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:08,140] which is another way of saying who knows.
[00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:13,900] When a Shaolin monk appeared on the road,
[00:40:13,900 --> 00:40:15,580] traveling in the opposite direction,
[00:40:17,060 --> 00:40:19,680] as the monk and the priest crossed paths,
[00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:21,960] Paimei,
[00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:27,700] in a practically unfathomable display of generosity,
[00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:31,500] gave the monk the slightest of nods.
[00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:37,260] The nod was not returned.
[00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:46,060] Now, was it the intention of the Shaolin monk to insult Paimei,
[00:40:47,060 --> 00:40:51,340] or did he just fail to see the generous social gesture?
[00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:56,560] The motives of the monk remain unknown.
[00:40:57,700 --> 00:41:01,200] What is known were the consequences.
[00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:19,060] The next morning, Paimei appeared at the Shaolin temple,
[00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:23,960] and demanded of the temple's head abbot
[00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:26,580] that he offer Paimei his neck
[00:41:26,580 --> 00:41:28,940] to repay the insult.
[00:41:31,100 --> 00:41:34,200] The abbot at first tried to console Paimei,
[00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:40,060] only to find Paimei was inconsolable.
[00:41:40,060 --> 00:41:41,060] So began...
[00:41:41,060 --> 00:41:45,060] The massacre of the Shaolin temple,
[00:41:45,060 --> 00:41:47,060] and all sixty of the monks inside,
[00:41:47,060 --> 00:41:49,060] at the fists of the White Lotus.
[00:41:49,060 --> 00:41:50,060] And...
[00:41:50,060 --> 00:41:51,060] So began...
[00:41:51,060 --> 00:41:52,060] the massacre...
[00:41:52,060 --> 00:41:53,060] of the Shaolin temple,
[00:41:53,060 --> 00:41:54,060] and all sixty of the monks inside,
[00:41:54,060 --> 00:41:55,060] at the fists of the White Lotus.
[00:41:55,060 --> 00:41:56,060] And...
[00:41:56,060 --> 00:41:57,060] So began...
[00:41:57,060 --> 00:41:58,060] The legend...
[00:41:58,060 --> 00:41:59,060] of Paimei's...
[00:41:59,060 --> 00:42:00,060] Five-point palm exploding heart technique.
[00:42:00,060 --> 00:42:00,560] And what, pray tell,
[00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:02,060] is the five-point palm exploding heart technique?
[00:42:02,060 --> 00:42:03,060] Quite simply...
[00:42:03,060 --> 00:42:04,060] The deadliest blow...
[00:42:04,060 --> 00:42:05,060] in all of martial arts.
[00:42:05,060 --> 00:42:07,060] he hits you...
[00:42:07,060 --> 00:42:08,060] with his fingertips...
[00:42:08,060 --> 00:42:09,640] and it lets you walk away...
[00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:30,060] ... affly at five different pressure points on your body...
[00:42:32,060 --> 00:42:33,060] and...
[00:42:33,060 --> 00:42:35,060] As you walk away
[00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:41,780] Once you've taken five steps your heart explodes inside your body
[00:42:42,940 --> 00:42:44,940] And you fall to the floor
[00:42:47,180 --> 00:42:49,280] Did he teach you that no
[00:42:51,180 --> 00:42:56,780] He teaches no one my five-point palm exploding heart technique now
[00:42:58,500 --> 00:43:00,860] One of the things I've always liked about you
[00:43:00,860 --> 00:43:02,860] You know
[00:43:05,420 --> 00:43:07,800] You appear wise beyond your years
[00:43:12,300 --> 00:43:15,560] So allow me to impart a word to the wise
[00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:22,080] Whatever whatever I may says obey
[00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:28,780] If you flash him even for an instant a defiant eye he'll pluck it out
[00:43:28,780 --> 00:43:33,460] And if you throw any American sass his way
[00:43:34,540 --> 00:43:37,540] He'll snap your back and your neck like they were twigs
[00:43:41,140 --> 00:43:43,140] And that will be the story of you
[00:43:43,140 --> 00:43:52,900] He'll accept you as his student
[00:43:52,900 --> 00:44:06,660] He'll accept you as his student
[00:44:06,660 --> 00:44:07,660] What happened to you?
[00:44:07,660 --> 00:44:08,160] Gotcha
[00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:09,660] Get in a fight?
[00:44:09,660 --> 00:44:10,660] Friendly contest
[00:44:10,660 --> 00:44:11,660] Friendly contest
[00:44:11,660 --> 00:44:12,660] Friendly contest
[00:44:12,660 --> 00:44:13,660] Why did he accept me?
[00:44:13,660 --> 00:44:17,420] Because he's a very very very old man
[00:44:17,420 --> 00:44:20,420] And like all rotten bastards
[00:44:20,420 --> 00:44:22,420] When they become old
[00:44:22,420 --> 00:44:24,420] They get lonely
[00:44:24,420 --> 00:44:25,420] Friendly
[00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:27,420] Which
[00:44:27,420 --> 00:44:29,920] Has no effect on their dispositions
[00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:33,180] But it does teach them the value of company
[00:44:37,180 --> 00:44:37,680] Well
[00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:39,320] Just seeing those tips again
[00:44:40,080 --> 00:44:40,960] Makes me ache
[00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:46,720] You're gonna have a lot of fun carrying buckets of water up and down that fucker
[00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:53,720] When will I see you again?
[00:44:53,720 --> 00:44:57,720] That's the title of my favorite soul song of the seventies
[00:44:57,720 --> 00:44:58,720] What?
[00:44:58,720 --> 00:44:59,720] Nothing
[00:44:59,720 --> 00:45:00,720] Welcome to neither

[01:05:50,020 --> 01:05:51,740] I have to give it to you, bud.
[01:05:52,320 --> 01:05:54,080] That's a pretty fucked up way to die.
[01:05:55,200 --> 01:05:57,100] What's the name on the grave she's buried under?
[01:05:58,600 --> 01:05:59,120] Paula?
[01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,000] Paula?
[01:06:02,220 --> 01:06:02,820] Schultz.
[01:06:09,240 --> 01:06:10,420] Can I look at the sword?
[01:06:11,060 --> 01:06:13,600] That's my money right there in that red bag, isn't it?
[01:06:14,400 --> 01:06:15,900] It sure is.
[01:06:17,200 --> 01:06:19,200] Well then, it's your sword now.
[01:06:19,200 --> 01:06:20,040] Come on.
[01:06:39,320 --> 01:06:41,120] What's that you said?
[01:06:41,120 --> 01:06:43,860] So this is a Hattori Hanzo sword.
[01:06:43,860 --> 01:06:46,000] That's a Hanzo sword, all right.
[01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:48,260] Bill tells me you once had one of these of your own.
[01:06:49,200 --> 01:06:50,700] It was.
[01:06:50,700 --> 01:06:53,700] Yeah, how does this one compare to that?
[01:07:03,640 --> 01:07:07,760] If you're gonna compare a Hanzo sword,
[01:07:07,760 --> 01:07:12,260] you compare it to every other sword ever made
[01:07:12,260 --> 01:07:16,160] wasn't made by a Hattori Hanzo.
[01:07:19,200 --> 01:07:22,700] There you go.
[01:07:22,700 --> 01:07:25,700] Wrap your lips around that.
[01:07:25,700 --> 01:07:27,200] There you go.
[01:07:27,200 --> 01:07:28,200] Wrap your lips around that.
[01:07:38,620 --> 01:07:42,620] So, which hour are you filled with?
[01:07:42,620 --> 01:07:44,120] What?
[01:07:44,120 --> 01:07:45,120] What?
[01:07:49,120 --> 01:07:56,120] They say the number one killer of old people is retirement.
[01:07:56,120 --> 01:07:59,620] People got a job to do.
[01:07:59,620 --> 01:08:04,620] They tend to live a little bit longer so they can do it.
[01:08:04,620 --> 01:08:13,620] But I've always figured that warriors and their enemies share the same relationship.
[01:08:13,620 --> 01:08:19,120] So now that you're not gonna have to face your enemy no more on the battlefield,
[01:08:19,120 --> 01:08:24,120] which are you filled with?
[01:08:24,120 --> 01:08:25,620] Relief?
[01:08:25,620 --> 01:08:26,620] Or regret?
[01:08:26,620 --> 01:08:27,620] A little bit of both.
[01:08:27,620 --> 01:08:28,620] Or shit?
[01:08:28,620 --> 01:08:29,620] I'm sure you do feel a little bit of both.
[01:08:29,620 --> 01:08:46,120] But I know damn well that you feel one more than you feel the other.
[01:08:46,120 --> 01:08:54,620] And the question was, which one is it?
[01:08:54,620 --> 01:08:55,620] Regret.
[01:08:55,620 --> 01:08:59,620] You know, you gotta hand it to the old girl.
[01:08:59,620 --> 01:09:03,620] I never saw anybody buffaloed Bill the way she buffaloed Bill.
[01:09:03,620 --> 01:09:09,120] Bill thought she was so damn smart when I tried to tell him.
[01:09:09,120 --> 01:09:12,120] She was just smart for a blonde.
[01:09:12,120 --> 01:09:33,620] Thanks a bunch.
[01:09:33,620 --> 01:09:59,120] Sorry.
[01:09:59,120 --> 01:10:29,100] Thank you.
[01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:21,720] I'm sorry, bud.
[01:10:21,720 --> 01:10:23,900] That was rude of me, wasn't it?
[01:10:24,900 --> 01:10:28,420] Bud, I'd like to introduce my friend, the Black Mamba.
[01:10:28,420 --> 01:10:31,420] Black Mamba, this is Bud.
[01:10:31,420 --> 01:10:33,420] You know, before I picked that little fella up,
[01:10:33,420 --> 01:10:35,420] I looked him up on the internet.
[01:10:35,420 --> 01:10:38,420] Fascinating creature, the Black Mamba.
[01:10:38,420 --> 01:10:41,420] Listen to this.
[01:10:45,420 --> 01:10:49,420] In Africa, the saying goes, in the bush,
[01:10:49,420 --> 01:10:52,420] an elephant can kill you, a leopard can kill you,
[01:10:52,420 --> 01:10:54,420] and a Black Mamba can kill you.
[01:10:54,420 --> 01:10:57,420] But only with the Mamba, and this has been true in the past,
[01:10:57,420 --> 01:11:00,420] and this has been true in Africa since the dawn of time,
[01:11:00,420 --> 01:11:02,420] is death, sure.
[01:11:02,420 --> 01:11:06,420] Hence its handle, death incarnate.
[01:11:06,420 --> 01:11:08,420] Pretty cool, huh?
[01:11:09,420 --> 01:11:13,420] Its neurotoxic venom is one of nature's most effective poisons,
[01:11:13,420 --> 01:11:16,420] acting on the nervous system causing paralysis.
[01:11:16,420 --> 01:11:20,420] The venom of a Black Mamba can kill a human being in four hours,
[01:11:20,420 --> 01:11:23,420] if, say, bitten on the ankle or the thumb.
[01:11:23,420 --> 01:11:29,420] However, a bite to the face or torso can bring death from paralysis within 20 minutes.
[01:11:29,420 --> 01:11:33,420] Now, you should listen to this, because this concerns you.
[01:11:33,420 --> 01:11:40,420] The amount of venom that can be delivered from a single bite can be gargantuan.
[01:11:40,420 --> 01:11:43,420] You know, I've always liked that word, gargantuan.
[01:11:43,420 --> 01:11:46,420] I so rarely have an opportunity to use it in a sentence.
[01:11:46,420 --> 01:11:50,420] If not treated quickly with anti-venom,
[01:11:50,420 --> 01:11:53,420] 10 to 15 milligrams can be fatal to human beings.
[01:11:53,420 --> 01:12:01,420] However, the Black Mamba can deliver as much as 100 to 400 milligrams of venom from a single bite.
[01:12:01,420 --> 01:12:11,420] Now, in these last agonizing minutes of life you have left,
[01:12:11,420 --> 01:12:15,420] let me answer that question you asked earlier more thoroughly.
[01:12:18,420 --> 01:12:24,420] Right at this moment, the biggest R I feel is regret.
[01:12:24,420 --> 01:12:32,420] regret that maybe the greatest warrior I have ever met,
[01:12:32,420 --> 01:12:41,420] met her end at the hands of a bushwhackin', scrub, elky piece of shit like you.
[01:12:45,420 --> 01:12:47,420] That woman deserved better.
[01:12:54,420 --> 01:12:55,680] George fatal has no good punch,
[01:12:56,420 --> 01:12:59,420] but to her side was worse against many bald megs,
[01:12:59,420 --> 01:13:01,420] water dummy while all the blood 국민 is touched,
[01:13:01,420 --> 01:13:04,420] was that much secret?
[01:13:06,420 --> 01:13:06,560] That woman RMT said she made her兼ite
[01:13:06,560 --> 01:13:08,560] and asked her for what she did.
[01:13:08,560 --> 01:13:09,560] That woman was the twoLDs.
[01:13:09,560 --> 01:13:11,360] So I thought that she'll refuse it more andrue.
[01:13:13,560 --> 01:13:15,560] That man wasn't a pity at all the commercial side.
[01:13:15,560 --> 01:13:17,560] Let's have sex overcome so far and read the romance of undesirable.
[01:13:17,760 --> 01:13:19,600] Itzaos.
[01:13:22,280 --> 01:13:23,120] Tell her first person!
[01:13:23,120 --> 01:13:24,060] Oliver just as Oprah.
[01:13:24,420 --> 01:13:32,080] Bill.
[01:13:34,080 --> 01:13:36,040] I have some tragic news.
[01:13:37,220 --> 01:13:38,720] Your brother's dead.
[01:13:40,500 --> 01:13:41,960] I'm so sorry, baby.
[01:13:43,340 --> 01:13:45,620] She put a black mamba in his camper.
[01:13:46,620 --> 01:13:47,780] I got her, sweetie.
[01:13:48,200 --> 01:13:48,860] She's dead.
[01:13:51,720 --> 01:13:53,140] Let me put it this way.
[01:13:53,140 --> 01:13:55,300] You ever start feeling sentimental?
[01:13:55,940 --> 01:13:57,500] Go to Barstow, California.
[01:13:58,340 --> 01:14:01,320] When you get here, walk into a florist and buy a bunch of flowers.
[01:14:02,200 --> 01:14:06,460] Then you take those flowers to Huntington Cemetery on Fuller in Guadalupe.
[01:14:07,100 --> 01:14:11,220] Look for the headstone marked Paula Schultz and lay them on the grave.
[01:14:11,760 --> 01:14:17,120] Because you will be standing at the final resting place of Beatrix Kiddo.
[01:14:17,940 --> 01:14:19,040] Marty Cotroser?
[01:14:19,320 --> 01:14:19,720] Here.
[01:14:20,200 --> 01:14:21,120] Melanie Harhaus?
[01:14:21,520 --> 01:14:21,820] Here.
[01:14:21,820 --> 01:14:22,960] Beatrix Kiddo.
[01:14:23,560 --> 01:14:23,960] Here.
[01:14:24,860 --> 01:14:25,260] Look.
[01:14:26,340 --> 01:14:28,160] I can be there in about four hours.
[01:14:28,240 --> 01:14:29,060] You want me to come over?
[01:14:30,660 --> 01:14:31,640] No, no, no, no.
[01:14:31,680 --> 01:14:32,420] You need me, baby.
[01:14:32,540 --> 01:14:33,160] I'm there.
[01:14:36,920 --> 01:14:37,320] Okay.
[01:14:38,260 --> 01:14:39,300] I'm leaving now.
[01:14:39,820 --> 01:14:41,200] You go smoke some pot or something.
[01:14:41,360 --> 01:14:42,120] I'll be there soon.
[01:14:42,120 --> 01:14:46,540] I'm going to get you.
[01:14:50,800 --> 01:14:56,180] I'll be there soon.
[01:14:58,920 --> 01:15:00,240] I'll be there soon.
[01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:03,940] Aahhh!
[01:15:07,380 --> 01:15:09,300] Woah!
[01:15:23,020 --> 01:15:25,360] Ow!
[01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:33,840] Gross.
[01:15:33,840 --> 01:15:36,520] exponents
[01:15:44,220 --> 01:15:47,840] hores
[01:16:03,840 --> 01:16:06,840] fan
[01:16:33,840 --> 01:16:40,840] inken
[01:16:40,840 --> 01:17:06,900] Auf Wiedersehen.
[01:17:10,840 --> 01:17:14,280] To my brother Bud, the only man I ever loved.
[01:17:15,120 --> 01:17:15,400] Bill.
[01:17:27,040 --> 01:17:28,060] What's that?
[01:17:30,860 --> 01:17:32,380] Bud's hand's on sword.
[01:17:33,820 --> 01:17:35,380] He said he pawned it.
[01:17:36,500 --> 01:17:39,120] Guess that makes him a liar now, don't it?
[01:17:40,840 --> 01:17:44,040] L.
[01:17:44,920 --> 01:17:45,560] B.
[01:17:46,900 --> 01:17:49,060] Something I've always been curious about.
[01:17:50,160 --> 01:17:51,560] Just between us girls.
[01:17:53,640 --> 01:17:58,000] What did you say to Pi May to make him snatch out your eye?
[01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:05,300] I called him a miserable old fool.
[01:18:06,340 --> 01:18:09,260] Bad idea.
[01:18:10,840 --> 01:18:11,840] Know what I did?
[01:18:13,160 --> 01:18:16,560] I killed that miserable old fool.
[01:18:18,760 --> 01:18:20,060] How do you like the fish head?
[01:18:20,060 --> 01:18:21,640] Miserable old fool.
[01:18:21,640 --> 01:18:23,320] I poisoned his fish heads.
[01:18:23,440 --> 01:18:24,320] I throw him over.
[01:18:24,320 --> 01:18:25,640] Then please come over.
[01:18:25,640 --> 01:18:26,320] I'm a gal.
[01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:36,000] How's the killed?
[01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:43,880] To me, the word of an old fool like you is worth less than nothing.
[01:18:48,880 --> 01:18:50,060] That's right.
[01:18:50,720 --> 01:18:52,600] I killed your master.
[01:18:53,300 --> 01:18:54,780] And now I'm going to kill you too.
[01:18:55,720 --> 01:18:57,860] With your own sword, no less.
[01:18:57,860 --> 01:19:03,860] Which in the very immediate future will become my sword.
[01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:07,480] Bitch.
[01:19:09,040 --> 01:19:10,660] You don't have a future.
[01:19:27,860 --> 01:19:28,860] Ah!
[01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:41,980] Ahh!
[01:19:41,980 --> 01:19:42,980] Ah!
[01:19:42,980 --> 01:19:43,500] Ah!
[01:19:43,500 --> 01:19:44,080] No!
[01:19:44,080 --> 01:19:44,380] Ah!
[01:19:44,380 --> 01:19:45,100] Aah!
[01:19:45,100 --> 01:19:45,700] Ah!
[01:19:45,700 --> 01:19:47,700] Ah!
[01:19:47,700 --> 01:19:48,420] Ah!
[01:19:48,420 --> 01:19:49,500] Ah!
[01:19:50,960 --> 01:19:51,020] Ah!
[01:19:51,020 --> 01:19:54,800] Ah!
[01:19:54,800 --> 01:19:56,260] сер Elaine.
[01:19:56,260 --> 01:19:59,640] OPAAn!!!!
[01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:02,000] Get the fish!
[01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:04,000] Oh!
[01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:05,000] Oh!
[01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:07,000] Fuck you, bitch!
[01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:09,000] Fuck!
[01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:10,000] Fuck!
[01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:11,000] Fuck!
[01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:13,000] Fuck!
[01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:15,000] Get it!
[01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:17,000] Fuck!
[01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:18,000] Get it!
[01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:20,000] Fuck!

[01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:24,000] You!
[01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:26,000] Oh, no!
[01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:28,000] Oh, no!
[01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:31,000] I'm gonna kill you, bitch!
[01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:32,000] Fuck!
[01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:33,000] Fuck!
[01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:35,000] Oh, get you!
[01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:37,000] What you do?
[01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:39,000] I'm gonna kill you!
[01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:40,000] Shit!
[01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:41,000] Shit!
[01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:42,000] Where are you?
[01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:44,000] Let me fucking get you!
[01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:46,000] Shit!
[01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:47,000] Where are you?
[01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:50,000] And I'm coming too, fucking bitch!
[01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:52,000] You're fucking dead!
[01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:53,000] Shit!
[01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:54,000] You're gonna kill you!
[01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:55,000] Fuck!
[01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:56,000] Oh!
[01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:57,000] Shit!
[01:20:57,000 --> 01:21:06,000] Oh!
[01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:07,000] Shit!
[01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:12,000] Shit!
[01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:21,000] Hell, fuck!
[01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:21,800] do
[01:21:51,000 --> 01:22:20,980] Ellaивает con la Manor来ven
[01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:29,740] Like most men who never knew their father, Bill collected father figures.
[01:22:30,780 --> 01:22:33,240] The first was Esteban Vaheo.
[01:22:34,460 --> 01:22:37,120] Esteban was a pimp and a friend of Bill's mother.
[01:22:38,040 --> 01:22:41,240] He ran a brothel in Acuna, Mexico for over 50 years.
[01:22:42,240 --> 01:22:48,100] His army, the Acuna Boys, made up of the fatherless offspring of his whores, ran Acuna.
[01:22:49,020 --> 01:22:50,440] He ran the Acuna Boys.
[01:22:51,000 --> 01:23:00,560] Now at the age of 80, it would be this retired gentleman of leisure who could point me in Bill's direction.
[01:23:03,040 --> 01:23:04,600] Señor Esteban Vaheo?
[01:23:07,140 --> 01:23:07,780] Yes.
[01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:10,120] May I join you?
[01:23:12,460 --> 01:23:15,560] Only on the condition that you call me Esteban.
[01:23:16,360 --> 01:23:18,360] May I join you, Esteban?
[01:23:18,980 --> 01:23:19,500] Please.
[01:23:19,500 --> 01:23:20,500] Yes.
[01:23:25,060 --> 01:23:26,660] Yes.
[01:23:28,160 --> 01:23:30,400] I speak a little Spanish if you prefer.
[01:23:30,960 --> 01:23:31,760] No, no, no, no.
[01:23:31,760 --> 01:23:33,980] I prefer English.
[01:23:34,580 --> 01:23:36,140] I haven't spoken in a while.
[01:23:37,140 --> 01:23:43,120] But I would relish the opportunity to converse with such a pretty companion as yourself.
[01:23:43,120 --> 01:23:47,680] It's my pleasure to be in the company of such a fine gentleman as yourself.
[01:23:47,680 --> 01:23:49,780] I must warn you, young lady.
[01:23:50,920 --> 01:23:53,080] I am susceptible to flattery.
[01:23:53,080 --> 01:23:53,560] 줄 him.
[01:23:53,700 --> 01:23:54,120] I'm tempted to bring you out.
[01:23:54,120 --> 01:23:54,660] Mr.
[01:23:54,700 --> 01:23:58,960] The 14-year-old lover in late negations are here for your panel.
[01:23:59,220 --> 01:23:59,840] Ursus, ìI and I?î
[01:24:00,340 --> 01:24:00,960] 553
[01:24:01,040 --> 01:24:01,380] How may I be happy to do with this?
[01:24:02,960 --> 01:24:03,880] Oh, sure.
[01:24:03,880 --> 01:24:04,500] Here's it.
[01:24:04,500 --> 01:24:05,140] How may I be a service to you?
[01:24:05,180 --> 01:24:05,840] Okay.
[01:24:05,840 --> 01:24:08,340] Where's Bill?
[01:24:11,300 --> 01:24:12,140] Ah.
[01:24:13,840 --> 01:24:15,640] You must be big attracts.
[01:24:17,900 --> 01:24:19,720] I can see the attraction.
[01:24:22,700 --> 01:24:25,780] I remember when Bill was only five years old.
[01:24:26,540 --> 01:24:27,800] I took him to the movies.
[01:24:28,700 --> 01:24:31,300] He was a movie starring Alana Turner.
[01:24:32,440 --> 01:24:35,720] The postman always ringed twice with John Garfield.
[01:24:35,840 --> 01:24:39,640] And whenever she would appear on the screen,
[01:24:40,980 --> 01:24:43,960] Bill began compulsory to suck his thumb
[01:24:43,960 --> 01:24:45,920] too an obscene amount.
[01:24:46,520 --> 01:24:48,380] And I knew from this very moment
[01:24:48,380 --> 01:24:51,800] this boy was a fool for bronze.
[01:24:57,440 --> 01:24:58,160] Hmm.
[01:24:59,820 --> 01:25:00,320] You're...
[01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:07,000] No. Being a fool for a woman such as Rosano is always the right thing to do.
[01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:19,000] If we had met, when I was back in business, you would have been my number one lady.
[01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:25,000] Well, I'm flattered.
[01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:27,000] You got that what better be.
[01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:32,000] This. I didn't hear you were driving a truck.
[01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:35,000] My pussy wagon died on me.
[01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:38,000] The pussy died.
[01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:45,000] Bill shot you in the head, no?
[01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:46,000] Yes.
[01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:51,000] Why would have been much nicer?
[01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:54,000] Why would have just caught your face?
[01:25:57,000 --> 01:25:59,000] You must forgive me.
[01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:00,000] Please.
[01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:01,000] You have a drink with me.
[01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:06,000] Claren!
[01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:11,000] Morning.
[01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:16,000] Dos anillos.
[01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:18,000] Rules estavam not fun with this town.
[01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:27,000] Music distance kinda weakling.
[01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:41,000] What are we talking about?
[01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:46,000] Bill.
[01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:52,000] Where's Bill?
[01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:56,000] Where's Bill?
[01:26:56,000 --> 01:27:01,000] Bill is at the Via Cuadro on the road to Selena.
[01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:05,000] I will draw you a lamp.
[01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:09,000] Bill is like a song to me.
[01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:12,000] Do you know why I help you?
[01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:14,000] No.
[01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:17,000] Because he will want me to.
[01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:19,000] Now that I don't believe.
[01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:22,000] Ah.
[01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:26,000] Oh well, he will want to see you again.
[01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:36,000] Well...
[01:27:36,000 --> 01:28:05,980] guitar solo
[01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:35,980] guitar solo
[01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:37,160] Bang! Bang!
[01:28:38,920 --> 01:28:40,700] She got us, Bebe.
[01:28:40,920 --> 01:28:41,800] My goddess.
[01:28:42,340 --> 01:28:43,440] I'm dying.
[01:28:43,580 --> 01:28:44,920] I'm dying.
[01:28:48,060 --> 01:28:49,820] Slow down, sweetheart.
[01:28:50,080 --> 01:28:51,200] You shot us.
[01:28:53,820 --> 01:28:56,780] But little did quickdraw kiddo know
[01:28:56,780 --> 01:28:59,740] that little Bebe was only playing possum
[01:28:59,740 --> 01:29:04,760] due to the fact that she was impervious to bullets.
[01:29:05,340 --> 01:29:06,960] Impervious to bullets, Mommy.
[01:29:07,540 --> 01:29:08,680] Hey, get back down there.
[01:29:08,800 --> 01:29:09,700] You're playing possum.
[01:29:10,980 --> 01:29:15,200] So, as the smirking killer advanced
[01:29:15,200 --> 01:29:18,960] on what she thought was a bullet-ridden corpse,
[01:29:19,640 --> 01:29:21,980] that's when little Bebe fired.
[01:29:24,660 --> 01:29:25,760] Bang! Bang!
[01:29:25,760 --> 01:29:34,800] You're dead, Mommy.
[01:29:34,800 --> 01:29:36,720] So, die.
[01:29:38,880 --> 01:29:39,140] Oh!
[01:29:42,140 --> 01:29:43,840] Bebe.
[01:29:43,840 --> 01:29:48,820] Oh!
[01:29:50,140 --> 01:29:50,920] Bebe!
[01:29:52,580 --> 01:29:52,920] What?
[01:29:54,540 --> 01:29:55,920] I should have known.
[01:29:57,500 --> 01:29:58,840] You are...
[01:29:59,500 --> 01:29:59,920] the best.
[01:29:59,920 --> 01:30:00,960] You are...
[01:30:00,960 --> 01:30:03,560] the best friend.
[01:30:03,560 --> 01:30:06,080] Oh!
[01:30:17,120 --> 01:30:19,080] Okay.
[01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:10,080] Oh, Mommy, don't die.
[01:30:10,080 --> 01:30:12,380] I was just playing.
[01:30:18,380 --> 01:30:19,380] I know.
[01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:40,880] I told her you were asleep, but that one day you'd wake up and come back to her.
[01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:48,300] And she asked me, if Mommy's been asleep since I was born, then how will she know what I look like?
[01:30:49,260 --> 01:30:54,680] To which I replied, because Mommy's been dreaming of you.
[01:30:56,720 --> 01:30:57,800] That's what I said.
[01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:02,360] Did you dream of me? I dreamed of you.
[01:31:04,220 --> 01:31:06,700] Every single night, baby. Every single night.
[01:31:07,880 --> 01:31:10,840] I waited a long time for you to wake up, Mommy.
[01:31:23,460 --> 01:31:24,780] I'm gonna look at you.
[01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:27,620] Oh.
[01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:35,580] My, my, my, what a pretty little girl you are.
[01:31:36,360 --> 01:31:38,000] You're pretty, too, Mommy.
[01:31:44,420 --> 01:31:46,980] Tell Mommy what she said when I showed you her picture.
[01:31:48,360 --> 01:31:48,840] Mm-mm.
[01:31:48,840 --> 01:31:50,180] Come on.
[01:31:50,180 --> 01:31:50,220] Come on.
[01:31:50,220 --> 01:31:51,180] Come on.
[01:31:51,180 --> 01:31:54,300] You know what she said.
[01:31:54,300 --> 01:31:55,440] Come on.
[01:31:55,440 --> 01:31:56,560] Tell Mommy.
[01:31:56,560 --> 01:31:58,040] It'll make her feel good.
[01:31:58,040 --> 01:32:00,140] Mm-mm.
[01:32:00,140 --> 01:32:00,800] Yeah.
[01:32:00,800 --> 01:32:01,500] Come on.
[01:32:01,500 --> 01:32:10,000] I said, I said, you're the most beautifulest woman I ever saw in the whole white world.
[01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:12,000] That's the truth.
[01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:15,000] That's what she said.
[01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:22,260] Baby, don't you think Mommy has the prettiest hair in the whole wide world?
[01:32:22,260 --> 01:32:23,960] Yes, I do.
[01:32:23,960 --> 01:32:26,140] Matter of fact, it's better than pretty.
[01:32:26,140 --> 01:32:27,140] Mm-mm.
[01:32:27,140 --> 01:32:28,140] Gorgeous.
[01:32:28,140 --> 01:32:29,140] Very good.
[01:32:29,140 --> 01:32:30,140] Gorgeous.
[01:32:30,140 --> 01:32:31,140] Gorgeous.
[01:32:31,140 --> 01:32:32,140] Mommy is gorgeous.
[01:32:32,140 --> 01:32:33,140] Hmm.
[01:32:33,140 --> 01:32:38,140] You know, sweetie, Mommy's kinda mad at Daddy.
[01:32:38,140 --> 01:32:39,140] Why, Daddy?
[01:32:39,140 --> 01:32:40,140] Were you being a bad Daddy?
[01:32:40,140 --> 01:32:41,140] I'm afraid I was.
[01:32:41,140 --> 01:32:45,140] I was a real bad Daddy.
[01:32:45,140 --> 01:32:58,140] Our little girl learned about life and death the other day.
[01:32:58,140 --> 01:33:02,140] Wanna tell Mommy about what happened to Emilio?
[01:33:02,140 --> 01:33:06,140] I killed him.
[01:33:06,140 --> 01:33:09,140] Emilio was her goldfish.
[01:33:09,140 --> 01:33:12,140] Emilio was my goldfish.
[01:33:12,140 --> 01:33:19,140] She came running into my room, holding the fish in her hand, crying, Daddy, Daddy, Emilio's
[01:33:19,140 --> 01:33:20,140] dead.
[01:33:20,140 --> 01:33:21,140] And I said, really?
[01:33:21,140 --> 01:33:22,140] That's so sad.
[01:33:22,140 --> 01:33:23,140] How did he die?
[01:33:23,140 --> 01:33:24,140] And what did you say?
[01:33:24,140 --> 01:33:25,140] I stepped on him.
[01:33:25,140 --> 01:33:40,140] Actually, young lady, the words you so strategically used were, I accidentally stepped on him.
[01:33:40,140 --> 01:33:49,140] To which I queried, just how did your foot accidentally find its way into Emilio's fishbowl?
[01:33:49,140 --> 01:33:50,140] And she said, no, no, no.
[01:33:50,140 --> 01:33:53,140] Emilio was on the carpet when I stepped on him.
[01:33:53,140 --> 01:33:54,140] Mmm.
[01:33:54,140 --> 01:33:57,140] The plot thickens.
[01:33:57,140 --> 01:34:01,140] And just how did Emilio get on the carpet?
[01:34:01,140 --> 01:34:06,140] And Mommy, you would have been so proud of her.
[01:34:06,140 --> 01:34:10,140] She didn't lie.
[01:34:10,140 --> 01:34:17,140] She said she took Emilio out of his bowl and put him on the carpet.
[01:34:17,140 --> 01:34:22,140] And what was Emilio doing on the carpet?
[01:34:22,140 --> 01:34:24,140] Flapping.
[01:34:24,140 --> 01:34:27,140] And then you stomped on her.
[01:34:27,140 --> 01:34:28,140] Uh-huh.
[01:34:28,140 --> 01:34:33,140] And when you lifted up your foot, what was Emilio doing then?
[01:34:33,140 --> 01:34:34,140] Nothing.
[01:34:34,140 --> 01:34:39,140] He stopped flapping, didn't he?
[01:34:39,140 --> 01:34:52,140] She told me later that the second she lifted up her foot and saw Emilio not flapping, she knew what she had done.
[01:34:52,140 --> 01:34:57,140] Is that not the perfect visual image of life and death?
[01:34:57,140 --> 01:35:00,140] A fish flapping on the carpet.
[01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:04,000] A carpet and a fish not clapping on the carpet.
[01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:13,000] So powerful, even a four-year-old with no concept of life or death knew what it meant.
[01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:17,000] You loved Emilio, didn't you?
[01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:18,000] Uh-huh.
[01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:21,000] Well, I love Mommy too.
[01:35:23,000 --> 01:35:25,000] What I did to Mommy and what you did to Emilio.
[01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:27,000] You shocked the Mommy?
[01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:29,000] Worse.
[01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:31,000] I shot Mommy.
[01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:34,000] Not pretend shooting like we were just doing.
[01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:36,000] I shot her for real.
[01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:39,000] Why? Do you want to see what happened?
[01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:43,000] No, I knew what would happen to Mommy if I shot her.
[01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:48,000] What I didn't know was when I shot Mommy what would happen to me.
[01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:50,000] What happened?
[01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:52,000] I was very sad.
[01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:53,000] I was very sad.
[01:35:53,000 --> 01:35:55,000] And that's when I learned.
[01:35:55,000 --> 01:36:00,000] Some things, once you do, they can never be undone.
[01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:06,000] What happened to Mommy?
[01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:09,000] Why don't you ask Mommy?
[01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:11,000] You okay, Mommy? Does it hurt?
[01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:13,000] No, sweetie.
[01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:14,000] Doesn't hurt anymore.
[01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:15,000] Does it make you sick?
[01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:16,000] No.
[01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:17,000] It made me sleep.
[01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:18,000] That's why I haven't been with you, baby.
[01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:19,000] I've been asleep.
[01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:20,000] But you're awake now, Mommy, right?
[01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:21,000] I'm wide awake, pretty girl.
[01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:25,000] I'm wide awake, pretty girl.
[01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:32,000] Bebe, would you like Mommy to watch a video with you before sleepy time?
[01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:33,000] Uh-huh.
[01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:34,000] Mommy doesn't hurt.
[01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:35,000] I don't know.
[01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:36,000] It's a nice thing.
[01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:37,000] You're not.
[01:36:37,000 --> 01:36:38,000] I don't know.
[01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:41,000] I'm wide awake, pretty girl.
[01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:47,000] Bebe, would you like Mommy to watch a video with you before sleepy time?
[01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:48,000] Uh-huh.
[01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:52,000] Mommy, do you want to watch a video with me before sleepy time?
[01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:53,000] Oh, yeah.
[01:36:53,000 --> 01:36:54,000] I would love to.
[01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:55,000] Which one do you want to watch?
[01:36:55,000 --> 01:36:56,000] Shogun Assassin.
[01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:57,000] No, baby.
[01:36:57,000 --> 01:36:58,000] Shogun Assassin is too long.
[01:36:58,000 --> 01:36:59,000] Mm-mm.
[01:36:59,000 --> 01:37:00,000] No, it's not.
[01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:04,000] Well, then, I'll leave you ladies to it.
[01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:07,000] Oh, my God.
[01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:10,000] Oh, my God.
[01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:22,000] When I was little, my father was famous.
[01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:30,000] He was the greatest samurai in the empire, and he was the shogun's decapitator.
[01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:35,000] He cut off the heads of 131 lords.
[01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:42,000] My father would come home to mother, and when he'd see her, he'd forget about the killings.
[01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:47,000] He wasn't scared of the shogun, but the shogun was scared of him.
[01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:50,000] Maybe that was the problem.
[01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:54,000] One night, the shogun sent his majesty.
[01:37:54,000 --> 01:38:06,000] My man's got a heart like a rocket in the sea.
[01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:19,000] My man's got a heart like a rocket in the sea.
[01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:24,000] His last dish, his time he was wearing theadoresfahren sang counter.
[01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:27,000] From here, the streets total of 310 lords with schautlicb Companies.
[01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:28,000] It's a variety of thoughts.
[01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:30,000] I found there was a lot of male service people.
[01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:32,000] They enjoyed your life giving us.
[01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:36,000] The children's gallery of golden age, but theange is WHAT WE WERE less for.
[01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:41,000] The Żefeniac hacen centers could clear it for one day.
[01:38:41,000 --> 01:38:46,440] How many people cried
[01:38:46,440 --> 01:39:00,780] My man's got a heart
[01:39:00,780 --> 01:39:07,260] That's a rock and it's a dream
[01:39:07,260 --> 01:39:13,320] My man's got a heart
[01:39:13,320 --> 01:39:19,720] That's a rock and it's a dream
[01:39:19,720 --> 01:39:30,640] But no one told me about
[01:39:30,640 --> 01:39:36,060] The way she lied
[01:39:36,060 --> 01:39:43,060] Well no one told me about
[01:39:43,060 --> 01:39:48,840] How many people cried
[01:39:48,840 --> 01:39:55,540] But it's too late to say you're sorry
[01:39:55,540 --> 01:39:58,680] How would I know
[01:39:58,680 --> 01:40:00,000] Why'd she
[01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:02,000] I don't care.
[01:40:03,300 --> 01:40:08,500] Please don't bother trying to find her.
[01:40:09,000 --> 01:40:13,000] She's not there.
[01:40:15,800 --> 01:40:18,000] I was just admiring your sword.
[01:40:19,500 --> 01:40:21,000] A piece of work.
[01:40:22,500 --> 01:40:25,500] Speaking of which, how is Hansel's son?
[01:40:26,700 --> 01:40:28,000] He's good.
[01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:32,500] Has his sushi gotten any better?
[01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:37,500] I couldn't believe it.
[01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:40,500] You got him to make you sword.
[01:40:41,000 --> 01:40:42,500] It was easy.
[01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:45,000] I just dropped your name, Bill.
[01:40:45,500 --> 01:40:47,500] That'd do it.
[01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:05,500] No one told me about her
[01:41:05,500 --> 01:41:09,500] No one told me about her
[01:41:09,500 --> 01:41:17,500] No one told me about her
[01:41:17,500 --> 01:41:22,000] I suppose the idea is we crossed Hansel's swords.
[01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:23,000] Am I right?
[01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:23,500] All right?
[01:41:25,500 --> 01:41:28,500] Well, it just so happens
[01:41:28,500 --> 01:41:31,500] this hacienda has its own private beach
[01:41:32,500 --> 01:41:36,500] and that private beach just so happens to look particularly beautiful
[01:41:36,500 --> 01:41:38,500] bathed in moonlight
[01:41:38,500 --> 01:41:43,000] and there just so happens to be a full moon out tonight
[01:41:43,000 --> 01:41:45,000] so, sword fighter
[01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:47,000] if you want a sword fight
[01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:49,000] that's where I suggest
[01:41:49,000 --> 01:41:51,000] but
[01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:54,000] if you want to be old school about it
[01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:57,000] and you know I'm all about old school
[01:41:57,000 --> 01:41:59,500] then we could wait until dawn
[01:41:59,500 --> 01:42:01,500] and slice each other up at sunrise
[01:42:01,500 --> 01:42:04,000] like a couple of real life Hansel's
[01:42:06,500 --> 01:42:07,500] Now
[01:42:07,500 --> 01:42:08,500] if you don't settle down
[01:42:08,500 --> 01:42:10,500] I'm gonna have to put one in your kneecap
[01:42:10,500 --> 01:42:14,500] and I hear tell that's a very painful place to get shot in
[01:42:14,500 --> 01:42:20,000] I'm just fucking with you
[01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:23,000] Now
[01:42:23,000 --> 01:42:26,000] when it comes to you
[01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:28,000] and us
[01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:33,000] I have a few unanswered questions
[01:42:33,000 --> 01:42:34,000] So
[01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:36,000] before this tale
[01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:37,000] of bloody revenge
[01:42:37,000 --> 01:42:39,000] reaches its climax
[01:42:39,000 --> 01:42:42,000] I'm gonna ask you some questions
[01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:44,500] and I want you to tell me the truth
[01:42:44,500 --> 01:42:46,500] however
[01:42:46,500 --> 01:42:48,500] therein lies a dilemma
[01:42:48,500 --> 01:42:50,500] because
[01:42:50,500 --> 01:42:52,500] when it comes to the subject of me
[01:42:52,500 --> 01:42:53,500] I believe
[01:42:53,500 --> 01:42:55,500] you are truly
[01:42:55,500 --> 01:42:56,500] and utterly incapable
[01:42:56,500 --> 01:42:57,500] of telling the truth
[01:42:57,500 --> 01:42:58,500] especially to me
[01:42:58,500 --> 01:42:59,500] and
[01:42:59,500 --> 01:43:00,500] least of all
[01:43:00,500 --> 01:43:01,500] to yourself
[01:43:01,500 --> 01:43:03,500] and
[01:43:03,500 --> 01:43:05,500] when it comes to the subject of me
[01:43:05,500 --> 01:43:06,500] I am
[01:43:06,500 --> 01:43:07,500] truly
[01:43:07,500 --> 01:43:08,500] and utterly
[01:43:08,500 --> 01:43:09,500] incapable
[01:43:09,500 --> 01:43:10,500] of believing
[01:43:10,500 --> 01:43:11,500] anything
[01:43:11,500 --> 01:43:12,500] you say
[01:43:12,500 --> 01:43:15,000] how do you suppose we solve this dilemma
[01:43:15,000 --> 01:43:16,000] well
[01:43:17,000 --> 01:43:18,000] it just so happens
[01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:21,000] I have a solution
[01:43:21,000 --> 01:43:23,000] gotcha
[01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:24,500] well
[01:43:24,500 --> 01:43:26,000] damn
[01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:32,000] what the fuck did you just shoot me with
[01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:34,000] my greatest invention
[01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:35,000] or at least my favorite
[01:43:35,000 --> 01:43:37,000] don't touch it
[01:43:37,000 --> 01:43:39,000] or I'll stick another one right in your cheek
[01:43:39,000 --> 01:43:41,500] what lies within that dart
[01:43:41,500 --> 01:43:42,500] just
[01:43:42,500 --> 01:43:44,500] begging to course its way through your veins
[01:43:44,500 --> 01:43:45,500] is an incredibly potent
[01:43:45,500 --> 01:43:47,500] and quite infallible truth serum
[01:43:47,500 --> 01:43:48,500] I call it
[01:43:48,500 --> 01:43:49,500] the undisputed truth
[01:43:49,500 --> 01:43:51,500] twice as strong as sodium pentothal
[01:43:51,500 --> 01:43:53,500] with no druggy after effects
[01:43:53,500 --> 01:44:04,000] except for
[01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:05,000] except for
[01:44:05,000 --> 01:44:07,000] a slight wave of euphoria
[01:44:07,000 --> 01:44:09,000] you feel it?
[01:44:09,000 --> 01:44:10,000] euphoria?
[01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:11,000] yeah
[01:44:11,000 --> 01:44:12,000] no
[01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:13,000] too bad
[01:44:13,000 --> 01:44:14,000] too bad
[01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:14,500] too bad
[01:44:14,500 --> 01:44:15,000] too bad
[01:44:16,500 --> 01:44:17,500] as you know
[01:44:17,500 --> 01:44:19,500] I'm quite keen
[01:44:19,500 --> 01:44:21,500] on comic books
[01:44:21,500 --> 01:44:24,500] especially the ones about superheroes
[01:44:24,500 --> 01:44:27,500] I find the whole mythology
[01:44:27,500 --> 01:44:29,500] surrounding superheroes
[01:44:29,500 --> 01:44:30,500] fascinating
[01:44:30,500 --> 01:44:31,500] take
[01:44:31,500 --> 01:44:33,500] my favorite superhero
[01:44:33,500 --> 01:44:34,500] Superman
[01:44:34,500 --> 01:44:36,500] not a great comic book
[01:44:36,500 --> 01:44:38,500] not particularly well drawn
[01:44:38,500 --> 01:44:43,500] but
[01:44:43,500 --> 01:44:45,500] the mythology
[01:44:45,500 --> 01:44:46,500] the mythology
[01:44:46,500 --> 01:44:47,500] is not only great
[01:44:47,500 --> 01:44:48,500] it's unique
[01:44:48,500 --> 01:44:53,000] how long does this shit take to go into effect?
[01:44:53,000 --> 01:44:54,000] about two minutes
[01:44:54,000 --> 01:44:57,000] just long enough for me to finish my point
[01:44:57,000 --> 01:44:58,000] now
[01:44:58,000 --> 01:45:00,000] a staple
[01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:03,740] of the superhero mythology is there's the superhero
[01:45:03,740 --> 01:45:05,120] and there's the alter ego.
[01:45:05,960 --> 01:45:07,440] Batman is actually Bruce Wayne.
[01:45:08,140 --> 01:45:09,760] Spider-Man is actually Peter Parker.
[01:45:11,080 --> 01:45:13,000] When that character wakes up in the morning,
[01:45:13,300 --> 01:45:14,340] he's Peter Parker.
[01:45:15,400 --> 01:45:18,860] He has to put on a costume to become Spider-Man.
[01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:24,940] And it is in that characteristic Superman stands alone.
[01:45:26,460 --> 01:45:28,500] Superman didn't become Superman.
[01:45:28,500 --> 01:45:30,980] Superman was born Superman.
[01:45:31,980 --> 01:45:34,580] When Superman wakes up in the morning, he's Superman.
[01:45:36,100 --> 01:45:38,280] His alter ego is Clark Kent.
[01:45:39,500 --> 01:45:41,880] His outfit with the big red S.
[01:45:43,020 --> 01:45:45,620] That's the blanket he was wrapped in as a baby
[01:45:45,620 --> 01:45:46,700] when the Kents found him.
[01:45:46,980 --> 01:45:48,620] Those are his clothes.
[01:45:49,740 --> 01:45:52,960] What Kent wears, the glasses, the business suit,
[01:45:53,340 --> 01:45:54,380] that's the costume.
[01:45:54,380 --> 01:45:59,300] That's the costume Superman wears to blend in with us.
[01:46:01,460 --> 01:46:03,660] Clark Kent is how Superman views us.
[01:46:04,760 --> 01:46:07,100] And what are the characteristics of Clark Kent?
[01:46:07,820 --> 01:46:08,900] He's weak.
[01:46:10,340 --> 01:46:11,920] He's unsure of himself.
[01:46:11,920 --> 01:46:14,320] He's a coward.
[01:46:16,320 --> 01:46:20,620] Clark Kent is Superman's critique on the whole human race.
[01:46:22,920 --> 01:46:27,100] Sort of like Beatrix Kiddo and Mrs. Tommy Plimpton.
[01:46:27,100 --> 01:46:29,100] So...
[01:46:30,580 --> 01:46:32,580] The point emerges.
[01:46:34,740 --> 01:46:37,420] You would have worn the costume of Arlene Plimpton.
[01:46:38,380 --> 01:46:40,560] But you were born Beatrix Kiddo.
[01:46:42,280 --> 01:46:44,580] And every morning when you woke up,
[01:46:45,340 --> 01:46:47,280] you'd still be Beatrix Kiddo.
[01:46:47,800 --> 01:46:50,000] Oh, you can take the needle out.
[01:46:50,000 --> 01:46:58,920] Are you calling me a superhero?
[01:46:59,340 --> 01:47:00,580] I'm calling you a killer.
[01:47:01,860 --> 01:47:03,480] A natural born killer.
[01:47:04,840 --> 01:47:05,780] You always have been.
[01:47:06,280 --> 01:47:07,700] And you always will be.
[01:47:08,580 --> 01:47:09,580] Moving to El Paso.
[01:47:10,580 --> 01:47:13,180] Working in a used record store.
[01:47:13,180 --> 01:47:15,740] Going to the movies with Tommy.
[01:47:16,780 --> 01:47:18,060] Clipping coupons.
[01:47:18,060 --> 01:47:19,100] That's you.
[01:47:20,120 --> 01:47:23,300] Trying to disguise yourself as a worker bee.
[01:47:23,800 --> 01:47:25,900] That's you trying to blend in with the hive.
[01:47:26,880 --> 01:47:28,400] But you're not a worker bee.
[01:47:30,060 --> 01:47:32,080] You're a renegade killer bee.
[01:47:33,340 --> 01:47:36,620] And no matter how much beer you drank or barbecue you ate or...
[01:47:38,060 --> 01:47:39,160] How fat your ass got,
[01:47:39,160 --> 01:47:42,800] nothing in the world would ever change that.
[01:47:45,460 --> 01:47:46,620] First question.
[01:47:48,060 --> 01:47:54,000] Did you really think your life in El Paso was going to work?
[01:48:00,800 --> 01:48:01,680] No.
[01:48:06,020 --> 01:48:07,860] But I would have had Bebe!
[01:48:07,860 --> 01:48:10,740] Don't get me wrong.
[01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:14,060] I think you would have been a wonderful mother.
[01:48:16,040 --> 01:48:17,260] But you are a killer.
[01:48:22,680 --> 01:48:24,600] All those people you killed to get to me...
[01:48:24,600 --> 01:48:27,000] felt damn good, didn't they?
[01:48:30,500 --> 01:48:30,880] Yes.
[01:48:30,880 --> 01:48:34,060] Every single one of them.
[01:48:45,620 --> 01:48:46,020] Yes.
[01:48:50,340 --> 01:48:51,880] That was the warm-up round.
[01:48:51,880 --> 01:48:52,880] Now...
[01:48:52,880 --> 01:48:53,880] Now...
[01:48:53,880 --> 01:48:56,880] comes the $64,000 question.
[01:49:04,920 --> 01:49:06,420] Why did you run away from me?
[01:49:06,420 --> 01:49:07,460] With my baby?
[01:49:12,540 --> 01:49:15,100] Do you remember the last assignment you sent me home?
[01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:16,880] So, you called me?
[01:49:26,840 --> 01:49:26,860] Of course.
[01:49:27,960 --> 01:49:28,440] Lisa Wong.
[01:49:28,440 --> 01:49:32,440] So I started thinking...
[01:49:32,440 --> 01:49:36,440] maybe I was pregnant.
[01:49:36,440 --> 01:49:42,440] Easy to use. Remove cap and urinate on the absorbent end for five seconds.
[01:49:42,440 --> 01:49:46,440] Accurate results in only 90 seconds.
[01:49:46,440 --> 01:49:50,440] You can read the results as soon as the line appears on the window.
[01:49:58,440 --> 01:50:02,440] Turn on, push it.
[01:50:02,440 --> 01:50:03,920] If youervicing apologise
[01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:28,240] What I didn't know
[01:50:28,240 --> 01:50:31,060] was that somewhere on my journey
[01:50:31,060 --> 01:50:32,100] I had been spotted.
[01:50:33,260 --> 01:50:34,460] With me in L.A.,
[01:50:34,460 --> 01:50:36,340] it didn't take Lisa Wong long
[01:50:36,340 --> 01:50:38,780] to send an assassin of her own.
[01:50:40,660 --> 01:50:41,840] Hello, can I help you?
[01:50:42,420 --> 01:50:43,680] Hello, I'm Karen Kim.
[01:50:43,780 --> 01:50:45,660] I'm the hospitality manager of the hotel.
[01:50:45,820 --> 01:50:47,320] I have a welcome gift from the management.
[01:50:47,760 --> 01:50:48,500] That's nice.
[01:50:48,680 --> 01:50:49,240] I'm...
[01:50:49,240 --> 01:50:52,280] Can you just leave it by the door?
[01:50:58,240 --> 01:51:06,580] You pretty good with that shotgun?
[01:51:06,840 --> 01:51:08,660] Not that I have to be at this range,
[01:51:08,760 --> 01:51:10,520] but I'm a fucking surgeon with this shotgun.
[01:51:10,820 --> 01:51:12,000] Well, guess what, bitch?
[01:51:12,360 --> 01:51:13,780] I'm better than Annie Oakley,
[01:51:13,840 --> 01:51:15,360] and I got you right in my sight.
[01:51:15,600 --> 01:51:17,280] I could blow your fucking head off.
[01:51:17,340 --> 01:51:19,320] Not before I put one right between your eyes.
[01:51:19,940 --> 01:51:20,860] So let's talk.
[01:51:23,600 --> 01:51:24,020] Karen?
[01:51:24,020 --> 01:51:30,600] Karen, I just found out right now,
[01:51:31,720 --> 01:51:35,420] not a moment before you blew a hole through the door,
[01:51:36,020 --> 01:51:38,780] that I'm pregnant.
[01:51:39,300 --> 01:51:40,160] What is this?
[01:51:41,740 --> 01:51:43,520] On the floor by the door
[01:51:43,520 --> 01:51:47,940] is a strip that says I'm pregnant.
[01:51:48,280 --> 01:51:48,820] Bullshit.
[01:51:48,820 --> 01:51:53,260] Any other time, you'd be 100% right.
[01:51:54,160 --> 01:51:55,040] But this time,
[01:51:55,940 --> 01:51:59,220] you're 100% wrong.
[01:52:01,220 --> 01:52:03,580] I'm the deadliest woman in the world.
[01:52:05,420 --> 01:52:06,300] But right now,
[01:52:07,560 --> 01:52:09,480] I'm just sketching this for my baby.
[01:52:10,980 --> 01:52:11,500] Please.
[01:52:13,840 --> 01:52:15,100] Just look at the strip.
[01:52:15,100 --> 01:52:19,180] Please.
[01:52:21,640 --> 01:52:23,580] Stay where you are
[01:52:23,580 --> 01:52:25,120] and don't move.
[01:52:25,120 --> 01:52:45,300] I don't know what this fucking shit means.
[01:52:45,580 --> 01:52:46,660] The box with the directions,
[01:52:46,660 --> 01:52:47,300] it's right there.
[01:52:47,300 --> 01:52:47,440] I don't know what this fucking shit means.
[01:52:47,440 --> 01:52:48,740] The box with the directions,
[01:52:48,740 --> 01:52:49,400] it's right there.
[01:52:49,400 --> 01:52:49,880] It's right there.
[01:52:55,120 --> 01:53:01,040] Easy to use.
[01:53:02,040 --> 01:53:04,660] Remove the cap and urinate.
[01:53:05,080 --> 01:53:06,520] The absorbent end.
[01:53:06,980 --> 01:53:08,000] Blue means pregnant.
[01:53:08,880 --> 01:53:10,540] I'll read it myself, thank you.
[01:53:18,540 --> 01:53:19,220] Okay.
[01:53:20,740 --> 01:53:22,380] Say I would have believed you, what then?
[01:53:22,940 --> 01:53:24,080] Just go home.
[01:53:25,120 --> 01:53:27,820] I'll do the same.
[01:53:48,580 --> 01:53:49,460] Congratulations.
[01:53:49,460 --> 01:53:57,500] Before that strip turned blue, I was a woman.
[01:53:57,640 --> 01:53:58,460] I was your woman.
[01:54:00,040 --> 01:54:02,120] I was a killer who killed for you.
[01:54:03,780 --> 01:54:08,480] Before that strip turned blue, I would have jumped a motorcycle onto a speeding train.
[01:54:09,980 --> 01:54:10,780] For you.
[01:54:10,780 --> 01:54:19,200] But once that strip turned blue, I could no longer do any of those things.
[01:54:20,200 --> 01:54:21,140] Not anymore.
[01:54:22,820 --> 01:54:24,360] Because I was going to be a mother.
[01:54:24,360 --> 01:54:30,060] Can you understand that?
[01:54:33,660 --> 01:54:34,180] Yes.
[01:54:36,060 --> 01:54:40,100] But why didn't you tell me then, still now?
[01:54:40,100 --> 01:54:43,020] Once you knew you'd claim her.
[01:54:44,100 --> 01:54:45,600] And I didn't want that.
[01:54:46,720 --> 01:54:48,700] Not your decision to make.
[01:54:49,560 --> 01:54:50,040] Yes.
[01:54:51,140 --> 01:54:54,120] But it's the right decision and I made it for my daughter.
[01:54:54,120 --> 01:54:59,040] She deserved to be born with a clean slate.
[01:54:59,040 --> 01:55:03,320] So, when we know she was given five minutes.
[01:55:03,320 --> 01:55:03,940] And then I was tried to press.
[01:55:03,940 --> 01:55:05,260] She tested three seconds around a hundred percent.
[01:55:05,260 --> 01:55:05,580] And if it was three seconds around sheNed, sheawa solution went into control.
[01:55:05,800 --> 01:55:07,960] But if it could, they had about all the foreigners.
[01:55:09,940 --> 01:55:11,200] See if you did well.
[01:55:11,240 --> 01:55:13,320] And I decided to waste damned weight to even algo.
[01:55:14,220 --> 01:55:15,060] Sometimes the other man was a family member would not glaube.
[01:55:15,900 --> 01:55:17,160] And he knows that he never outcomes.
[01:55:17,160 --> 01:55:18,900] So I made a religion and testing it.
[01:55:18,900 --> 01:55:19,540] Few weeks ago.
[01:55:19,540 --> 01:55:21,240] And by the pain of adding more bankruptcy,
[01:55:21,300 --> 01:55:21,620] you know, you been masked days.
[01:55:22,160 --> 01:55:22,920] And for example, you're looking into crying in the process,
[01:55:22,920 --> 01:55:24,860] sometimes like we've got some clues done.
[01:55:24,860 --> 01:55:26,000] Where there's a person hundredcoins might see a lawyer.
[01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:05,520] But with you, she would have been born into a world she shouldn't have.
[01:55:07,740 --> 01:55:09,300] I had to choose.
[01:55:11,120 --> 01:55:12,520] I chose her.
[01:55:15,580 --> 01:55:18,380] You know, five years ago,
[01:55:18,740 --> 01:55:22,820] if I had to make a list of impossible things that could never happen,
[01:55:23,900 --> 01:55:28,460] you performing a coup de grace on me by busting a cap in my crown,
[01:55:30,000 --> 01:55:33,400] would have been right at the top of the list.
[01:55:35,980 --> 01:55:37,740] I'd have been wrong, wouldn't I?
[01:55:39,440 --> 01:55:40,340] I'm sorry.
[01:55:41,260 --> 01:55:42,440] Was that a question?
[01:55:44,720 --> 01:55:47,620] Of impossible things that could never happen,
[01:55:47,740 --> 01:55:50,300] yes, in this instance, you would have been wrong.
[01:55:51,560 --> 01:55:52,140] Well?
[01:55:53,140 --> 01:55:55,500] When you never came back,
[01:55:55,500 --> 01:56:02,300] I naturally assumed Lisa Wong or somebody else had killed you.
[01:56:02,920 --> 01:56:04,920] Oh, and for the record,
[01:56:06,140 --> 01:56:11,580] letting somebody think somebody they love is dead when they're not is quite cruel.
[01:56:11,580 --> 01:56:18,820] I mourned you for three months.
[01:56:20,320 --> 01:56:22,900] And in the third month of mourning you,
[01:56:23,420 --> 01:56:25,940] I tracked you down.
[01:56:27,060 --> 01:56:29,120] I wasn't trying to track you down.
[01:56:29,120 --> 01:56:33,400] I was trying to track down the fucking assholes I thought killed you.
[01:56:34,700 --> 01:56:36,160] So I find you.
[01:56:38,160 --> 01:56:39,640] And what do I find?
[01:56:40,620 --> 01:56:43,000] Not only are you not dead,
[01:56:44,300 --> 01:56:45,660] you're getting married
[01:56:45,660 --> 01:56:47,960] to some fucking jerk.
[01:56:47,960 --> 01:56:58,720] I overreacted.
[01:56:58,720 --> 01:56:58,760] I overreacted.
[01:57:06,760 --> 01:57:08,980] You overreacted?
[01:57:09,700 --> 01:57:11,340] Is that your explanation?
[01:57:11,540 --> 01:57:13,380] No, I didn't say I was going to explain myself.
[01:57:13,380 --> 01:57:15,380] I said I was going to tell you the truth.
[01:57:16,680 --> 01:57:19,060] But if that's too cryptic,
[01:57:19,800 --> 01:57:20,620] let's get literal.
[01:57:22,920 --> 01:57:23,940] I'm a killer.
[01:57:25,540 --> 01:57:27,080] I'm a murdering bastard.
[01:57:27,180 --> 01:57:27,700] You know that?
[01:57:29,100 --> 01:57:31,300] And there are consequences
[01:57:31,300 --> 01:57:34,980] to breaking the heart of a murdering bastard.
[01:57:36,420 --> 01:57:38,120] You've experienced some of them.
[01:57:38,120 --> 01:57:45,580] Was my reaction really that surprising?
[01:57:46,840 --> 01:57:47,440] Yes.
[01:57:48,620 --> 01:57:49,700] It was.
[01:57:52,280 --> 01:57:54,960] Could you do what you did?
[01:57:56,140 --> 01:57:57,540] Of course you could.
[01:57:59,820 --> 01:58:01,400] But I never thought
[01:58:01,400 --> 01:58:06,160] you would or could do that to me.
[01:58:06,160 --> 01:58:08,460] I'm really sorry, kiddo.
[01:58:09,580 --> 01:58:11,240] But you thought wrong.
[01:58:17,880 --> 01:58:21,200] You and I have unfinished business.
[01:58:22,960 --> 01:58:23,640] Baby,
[01:58:24,640 --> 01:58:26,300] you ain't kidding.
[01:58:36,160 --> 01:58:36,400] ha!
[01:58:38,660 --> 01:58:38,820] ha!
[01:58:59,520 --> 01:59:00,820] PAM A taught you
[01:59:00,820 --> 01:59:02,660] the 5-point palm
[01:59:02,660 --> 01:59:04,160] exploding heart technique.
[01:59:04,160 --> 01:59:09,100] Of course he did.
[01:59:11,560 --> 01:59:13,340] Why didn't you tell me?
[01:59:17,500 --> 01:59:18,880] I don't know.
[01:59:22,240 --> 01:59:24,160] Because I'm...
[01:59:25,620 --> 01:59:26,720] a bad person.
[01:59:28,380 --> 01:59:29,200] No.
[01:59:31,660 --> 01:59:33,600] You're not a bad person.
[01:59:34,160 --> 01:59:37,160] You're a terrific person.
[01:59:37,160 --> 01:59:39,160] You're my favorite person.
[01:59:42,160 --> 01:59:44,160] But every once in a while,
[01:59:45,160 --> 01:59:47,160] you can be a real cunt.
[02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:09,500] I'll I look
[02:00:25,320 --> 02:00:26,980] You look ready
